"*This review is now updated for all 16 episodes*This review contains spoilers for seasons 1-3, so if you haven’t watched it (And idk how you call yourself an anime fan if you haven’t seen Attack On Titan) then please beware. Also, this review is about mainly the Attack On Titan series in general, not just Season 4. Here we are, 7 years in the making and we arrive at the finale of the masterpiece that is Attack On Titan. The true king of modern day shonen will have his last bow as he is instituted in the anime hall of fame with the conclusion ofthe final season. I remember way back in 2014 when I first watched Attack On Titan, the hype was insane so I thought I had to watch it. Unfortunately, 10 episodes in, I wasn’t feeling it. I thought it was another typical run of the mill shonen that was overhyped to oblivion. 3 years later comes Season 2 and the hype returned. I decided to finish it through Season 2, and from that moment on, I was hooked. The writing, the directing, the story, the music, the animation, it’s a beautiful combination to perfectly complement a beautiful anime. If you haven’t watched Attack On Titan (Seriously, who the hell hasn’t watched Attack On Titan yet) then please allow yourself to experience true peak fiction. 


Story: 9.5

I’d say the moment that made this anime a masterpiece was Season 2 Episode 6. From that episode on, the plot in Attack On Titan became so in depth and fascinating that I cannot comprehend having that creative of a mind. The first season fell victim to being pretty cliche and started off as very generic in terms of shonen troupes. The only thing that kept people hooked was the very unique setting and situations they were faced with. And I continued to believe that until Season 2 Episode 6, the great reveal. The revealing of Reiner and Bertoldt being the Armored and Colossal Titan. That was the first of many mind blowing plot twist that happen in this show, and needless to say, I was shook. The ability Hajime Isayama has to hide such major plot points in plain sight truly baffles me. I didn’t think it could get better, then Season 3 arrived. The Uprising Arc really expanded the setting to not just the scouts but also the political structure of the walls and how distrust between the military and the higher ups can cause chaos against humans vs humans. It showed the viewers that the Titans aren’t the only enemies that are in this show and it is fantastically done. Then, Oh lawd, and then we were blessed with Season 3 Part 2. How perfect and utterly flawless those 10 episodes were. Erwin’s Charge, Levi vs Beast Titan, the basement reveal, the explanation of mostly all questions we had while simultaneously creating even more questions. 3 of those 10 episodes have the highest rating out of any anime episode in history, and they're all back to back. I have literally yet to meet a human being who has watched Attack On Titan up to this point and still thinks it’s less than an 8/10. And now we arrive at Season 4. Attack on Titan seems to be a completely new show and takes in the viewpoint of the enemies that reside in Marley. You sometimes question which side you should truly be cheering for and whether you are a Jaegerist or not is up to you. Every side has their own goals and each consider the other as the ""bad guys."" This type of story is extremely fascinating and I'm super excited to see the final conclusion of the season and who will end up lasting till the very end.

Jeez, you can only give a series so much praise. I was enjoying the hell out of this season until the attack on Liberio. I fully understand that MAPPA was only given 8 months to complete this but the intense use of CGI was still very noticeable. For the time they were given, this is a masterpiece. In general though, yikes. I've been waiting for the Declaration Of War scene to be animated for years and when that episode came out, I was just sad. The Jaw and Cart Titan's CGI looks amazing, I could barely notice it most of the time. But the Beast and Attack Titan's CGI looks borderline abysmal in some frames. It was disappointing but hey, that's what you get when you rush a studio. As far as the non fight scenes go, MAPPA knocked it out of the park. Absolutely amazing studio that I hope gets the proper time to adapt the 2nd part of the Final Season.

Sound: 9 

No complaints here, the openings are legendary and the endings to par.

Characters: 8.5

If you pointed a gun at my head and forced me to say something bad about Attack On Titan, I would have to say the supporting characters, specifically the other scouts. I’m not saying they are poorly written, far from it, it’s just that they are more 2 dimensional then other characters. Connie, Sasha, Jean etc. are all decent characters, but that’s my complaint, their just decent. Of course though you have very well written and amazing characters like Eren, Erwin, Levi, Reiner, Kenny, Zeke etc. but you also have some of these more mediocre characters as well. I mean hell, the characters on the Marley side have more depth than the scouts tbh. Other than that, the characters are so god damn good, as a manga reader, Eren is one of my favorite anime characters of all time. Reiner’s struggles, Zeke’s push and pull between himself and Eldia, Erwin’s selfishness to his dream is something that just blows me away. Fantastic writing from a fantastic author.

Enjoyment: 8.5

After initially dropping it after the 10 episodes of Season 1 and rewatching it, I binged the entire thing in less than a week easy. And I could do it again just as easily. It’s literally impossible to get bored or sluggish when it comes to this anime, it’s a full fledged masterpiece. The adaptation for Season 4 made my enjoyment go from a 10 to an 8.5, but MAPPA did a well enough job for it to still be a solid 8.

Overall: 9

If you’ve looked at my anime list or seen my reviews, I don’t like shonen, I think the genre is very overrated. However, Attack On Titan is the diamond in the rough, it was an absolute treat to watch this anime and when it’s finally time for it to come to rest, I will be proud to say: I watched Attack On Titan.",2020-12-27T07:13:00+00:00,9
"If your expectation for Attack on Titan is an anime you can watch on a screen and hear with speakers, then this season will do you well, but if your expectations are a well directed, well organized story brought to life with beautiful animation crafted by a passionate team of talented artists and genius creatives, then you will be sorely disappointed, because unlike previous seasons, this production is so hideously ugly, you’d think Attack on Titan wasn’t the defining masterpiece of our era, which it most certainly is.There seems to be this odd and ignorant consensus pervading the fandom which suggests any and all criticismaimed at a poor product is somehow a direct insult to the workers who made it, and this is a shockingly immature worldview to espouse. Let me get one thing straight: you can say whatever you want about WIT Studio falling victim to Kodansha’s unfair and unreasonable production scheduling in the third season just like MAPPA is now, and how that lead to a double split-cour which ultimately wasn’t even enough to assure consistent quality throughout part two, but you must also admit pointing out these things is nothing more than a diversion from the far greater travesty of animation before you now. Attack on Titan: The Not-So-Final Season is a disgrace to the franchise which came before it on every visual level, and to say so is in no way to deride the overworked animation staff at MAPPA. Am I going to sit here and deny the existence of the throngs of rabid keyboard warriors on social media sending them death threats for producing such appalling CG and embarrassing 2D animation? No, but those people are foolish children with too much time on their hands, and by echoing their indisputably warranted criticisms, I and others like me are not justifying their acts of disrespect and harassment, so I urge you not to feel sorry for saying what you see clearly in front of you and criticizing it for what it is: an ugly, cheap anime. 

After episode six, I officially became a manga reader, since I simply could not let this atrocity be my first experience of Attack on Titan’s brilliant story, and what I found in the manga was absolutely stellar shot composition which I had previously thought was simply a product of Tetsuro Araki’s adaptation. Obviously, Araki’s heart-stopping visual direction and irreplaceable cinematic instinct made the anime adaptation what it ultimately was, but Hajime Isayama’s knack for framing an iconic single image when it mattered most still shouldn’t be overstated when the final season here has neither directorial flow nor memorable cinematics. The new character designs which pride themselves on their close resemblance to the original artwork found in the manga simply cannot use their adherence to the source material as a defense of their janky anatomy and inferiority to the beautiful artwork of Kyoji Asano, and the new music cannot use its passable composition as a defense of its utter incompatibility with Hiroyuki Sawano’s constantly recycled tracks. I understand this is a somewhat particular distinction to be made, but with the sheer amount of blatant animation shortcuts used throughout this season—not even counting the CG—season three part two looks like a studio trying their hardest while grappling with a ridiculous time table, whereas this looks like a studio using a ridiculous time table as an excuse to not try their hardest.

But nevertheless, does the masterful writing save the day and make this thing worth watching? With how much is cut out, rearranged, and left unfinished, I would say no, but that doesn’t make it bad. If anything, the narrative has only gotten better and the themes have only gone deeper. With the basement and its contents finally revealed, the series had to occupy the world it so suddenly established and situate the story as we knew it within that world elegantly, and even with the content from the manga which got butchered in translation, it absolutely achieved this feat. As it demystifies Marleyan society and rationalizes the international bigotry towards the Eldian people, it builds the foundation for one of the most interesting and morally provocative conflicts I've yet to see portrayed in fiction, and it does so with complex characters who never fail to inspire emotion, or inspiration itself. While Attack on Titan: The Not-So-Final season is, indeed, not the final season, it’s still an adaptation of a manga, so it continues the story with more or less the same degree of excellence as the first three seasons did, and while it abruptly ends on a cliffhanger mid-arc, that’s more a testament to the fragile production than the source material, its quality of writing, or the acuteness with which said writing was brought to screen. One thing’s for sure, though, narratives as enthralling as this come once in a generation, and it’s a shame this one is receiving such paltry treatment.

This review was originally going to be a lot more sentimental than it turned out to be. To cope with the extreme dejection I felt after watching such a dishonorable end to this once-great adaptation of an unequivocal masterpiece, I was going to try and write this review to examine the final season as a standalone work while simultaneously offering an all-encompassing retrospective on the modern classic that is Attack on Titan, but after WIT Studio dropped it and MAPPA shit it back out in such a visually repulsive and structurally incomplete fashion, I accepted the fact I couldn’t really do that anymore, and my enthusiasm burnt out along with the quality of the show itself. I’ve lost my motivation to even mind it anymore, and if the fact this season is among the highest rated anime on MAL didn’t make this obvious enough already, you all don’t seem to mind Attack on Titan anymore either. The reality that such a magnificently made work of art could receive such a stark downgrade yet still be well received by the exact same fanbase solely because they enjoy entertaining the mere idea of it is not only a sad reflection of the culture surrounding the work, but a cruel insult to the first three seasons which were only able to be the dazzling spectacles they were thanks to the back-breaking work ethic and tremendous talent of the original staff who so naively thought their admirable labor and impressive results weren’t lost on the audience, who’s appetite all can now clearly see as being apparently, totally mindless.

Thank you for reading.",2021-03-28T08:42:00+00:00,4
"Attack on Titan is a modern masterpiece. It’s not just a piece of fiction which has thrown quality season after season, it’s also one of the very few anime to have broken into the mainstream, so much so that people who do not watch anime at all have experienced and loved it. The emergence of the first season of Attack on Titan drove the series’ popularity to levels rarely seen before in the medium. The long wait before the release of season 2 was a major reason (along with certain pacing issues with the manga at the time) for the dying interest in the seriesat the time. By the time S2 aired, Attack on Titan wasn’t the global phenomenon anymore. One Punch Man had broken the mold in a similar vein to AoT S1 and become the new big anime amongst casuals and non anime watchers.

Then came Season 3, and the series was roaring back. The interest in the series had never been higher, and fans flocked back in droves to have their questions answered. Many began viewing the first two seasons in new light once the revelations showcased the intricate planning and immense foreshadowing that had gone under their noses when they’d watched it first. For me, Attack on Titan was always great. Never has an anime made me feel so hopeless if I viewed the world from the perspective of the characters. The absolute mystery surrounding the titans for most of the first season along with stunning animation for fights, memorable OST for almost any scene and emotional dialogue delivered by passionate voice actors made for an unforgettable experience. Season 2 and 3 bring in more revelations, slowly unfolding the mysteries of the world and the titans and shifting the themes of the series. Season 4 has another tonal shift - much greater than previous ones - and it handles it with aplomb.

A change in studios has often led anime series to ruin. The aforementioned OPM was one of the recent big victims of it, but other popular series like Seven Deadly Sins have also suffered due to it and never recovered.

Fortunately, MAPPA have handled the transition well. They haven’t been perfect (more on that later), but all in all, they’ve done a good job producing a new season of what is probably the most popular anime of the last decade.

The start of S4 might have left some people wondering where the original cast went. There’s not just a change of cast in the first few episodes, but also a switch in perspectives. We’re no longer seeing things from the side of Paradis and the Scouts. Instead, we now see it from the view of Marley’s warriors, who’re training to inherit the titans from their predecessors once their time runs out. Gabi and Falco want to inherit the armor but Reiner, i.e. the plot armored titan (Sorry, had to use this once I saw it on Reddit) can’t catch a break. Someone, grant him his wish to die.

Eren’s growth as a character is one of the highlights of Attack on Titan as a series. He wasn’t always a fan favorite because of his hotheaded nature, but as time went on, his perspective of the things around him changed, most noticeably multiple times throughout season 3. Come season 4, his character undergoes a paradigm shift; calm and sympathetic, yet ruthless. As his famous quote goes, “I won’t stop moving forward until all my enemies are destroyed.” He’s a lot more distant, not just to everyone else in the show but also to the viewers. Unlike previous seasons, his thoughts are a mystery and the season clearly displays the divide between him and the other old Scouts. 

The handling of his growth as a person and a titan shifter is outstanding, firstly in the manga and then in the anime. Yuki Kaji, the voice actor, supported this exponential growth by exceeding expectations on character delivery. I especially love how well he’s transitioned seamlessly along with Eren as a character and nailed almost every line. There’s hardly a line Eren has spoken in season 4 that isn’t extremely significant to the story.

Oh Gabi! Where do I even begin? She’s supposed to be the female parallel to pre timeskip Eren, but apart from some core traits like being stubborn, she isn’t really that similar to him. Gabi hates the Eldians from Paradis for no other reason other than that she thinks they’re devils and should suffer for the crimes of their ancestors. Eren was stubborn, headed into almost unwinnable battles without a second thought. However, his reasons to hate the titans were justified. His mother was eaten in front of him by a titan, his home destroyed and tens upon hundreds of his comrades butchered by titans in cold blood. He fought for his freedom, and humanity’s. 

Gabi, on the other hand, hates Eldians without having seen any of them. She kills people for glory, just for some useless praise. And without spoiling anything, I’ll also add that she’s a hypocrite with her iconic line that’s become prevalent in memes now “But did you see it happen?”.

In her defence, she’s a twelve-year-old girl who’s been brainwashed so it’s hard to not give her some benefit of the doubt. But boy, is she annoying! She’s actually portrayed a lot better at the start of the Marley arc in the anime than in the manga, so I didn’t dislike her as much. She’s neither a bad character nor a great one, but she serves her purpose.

Onto Falco, then. My cute, lovable boy, are you sure you had the same upbringing as Gabi? He’s her polar opposite, able to empathize with his enemies and an antithesis for every one of Gabi’s morals. He views things from a wider angle, often showing maturity way beyond his years. He might not be as naturally gifted as Gabi but he’s a whole lot more likeable. From posting letters for injured people to helping his enemies who shun him instead, this good boy has it all covered. He’s one of the beautiful things in this cruel world.

Pieck is the new waifu that every fan seems to be simping over; Reiner and Zeke share the title of best character amongst the Marleyans for me. Their internal struggles and motives, some of which are only seen by viewers, make a significant contrast to their outer persona, and this holds especially true for Zeke. 

Jean remains the character who makes the viewers question their morals because he questions his own and that’s what I love about him. He’s another one who’s come a long way since the cadet days.

Did you think I’d have forgotten Floch? He might’ve been a forgettable side character who didn’t even have a distinct design before S3 P2 (Isayama has himself admitted as much), but he’s one of the stars of season 4, running the show like the chad that he is. He’s an extremist and his actions are brutal; at times, it seems as if he’s doing it to sate his own ego and hate towards those who’ve imprisoned him and his race behind the walls. But despite all this, he’s one of the most entertaining characters post time skip. He’s unpredictable, spunky and has the audacity to pull off stunts that might’ve had your jaws slacking on the floor more times than one. And who can forget the “shh?” King Floch has unquestionably engraved his name as an Attack on Titan legend. 

There are so many excellent characters in Attack on Titan that the review would be too long if I talked about all of them, so I’ll stop here. 

The character designs in Season 4 see a distinct change, and that’s not all to do with the timeskip or the change in the studio. It’s a mixture of both. To anyone who’s read the earlier chapters of the Attack on Titan manga, it’s no secret that the art at the start was mediocre. Wit Studio did a great job of enhancing the character designs and the art in general, especially in S1.

MAPPA on the other hand have stuck closer to the manga art style for characters (apart from beautifying Armin as compared to the manga, their reasons for which I’d like to know). So there’s a slight change in the art style because they’re following Isayama’s art a lot more closely.

The animation of S4 has been the most talked about point, and for good reason. I’ll mince no words: some of the CGI was downright terrible. There was some genuinely impressive CGI like the Jaw titan, but some very important scenes involving the Attack Titan and Beast Titan were horrendous. It’s not the animators who’re to blame for this but the greed of the production committee and the manga publishers who wanted to have S4 airing before the end of the manga to boost sales.

For almost any other anime, I would’ve let even the terrible CGI scenes slide, but this is Attack on Titan, one of the most popular and highly acclaimed anime ever, and surely it deserved the best treatment possible. Unfortunately, it didn’t get that. Does it make the season bad? Of course not since the season covers one of the best arcs in the manga and the adaptation itself was faithful with top tier voice acting. Could better animation elevate S4 of Attack on Titan to higher levels? Greatly.

My biggest problem with the titan CGI was that it just broke immersion. One moment we had fluid 2D animation, the other we had some janky CGI lacking weight, which made me pause and check if I was still watching Attack on Titan. I’ve re-watched these scenes multiple times and every time, I came to the same conclusion: Attack on Titan deserves better. Remember the marvelous scenes with ODM gear we got in the first three seasons or the titan fights or Levi vs the Beast Titan? Unfortunately, we don’t get that level of animation in season 4, and while understandable given the time constraints, it’s disappointing nevertheless.

The CGI wasn’t always as bad, but had enough prevalence in the most important moments (Eg: Attack Titan vs Warhammer Titan) to be a stain on an otherwise stellar season.
 
We have some new and honestly breathtaking tracks added to the already great OST from S1 - S3. One of the highlights in the sound composition this season is that there were different composers depending on whose perspective a scene is shown from. For Paradis, we have Hiroyuki Sawano back with all our favorites from previous seasons while Kohta Yamomoto handled the Marleyan side, giving us bangers including Ashes on the Fire. I missed the old OST in the first few episodes because I was worried they’d underuse S1-S3 OST, but they did not. It wasn’t used much because the initial episodes take place from the perspective of the Marleyans. Honestly, having different composers for either side of the conflict seems like a superb choice and helps immersion. 

The only real criticism I have about the sound was the OST choice in some scenes in the latter part of the season. And no, I’m not talking about the basement scene here. I thought the basement scene OST choice was great.

Similar to the OST, it took a while for me to warm up to the OP, but looking back now, it’s great and suits the themes of S4. This was a common opinion amongst the community; the majority seemed to have disliked My War for the first couple episodes, then it just grew on people and now it sets the tone for the rest of the episode.

Now that Attack on Titan’s final season (Part 1) has ended, it’ll be intriguing to see what route MAPPA takes for the rest of the adaptation. There’s anywhere between 13-16 episodes of content left to cover, depending on the pacing. Will the production committee see Attack on Titan as a chance to make hundreds of millions of dollars in a movie format or will we have Attack on Titan Final Season Part 2 (lol), only time will tell. I’m not against either, as long as they take enough time and pour passion into making it. I don’t mind waiting longer if it means getting the best production values. Hopefully, that’s the case.",2021-03-28T08:35:00+00:00,10
"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSEvery once in a while, once in a century, once in a millenia, once in an eon, humanity gets a shining star. A star that reshapes humanity for times ahead, a star, that, despite being a mortal human, remains immortal in history. Jesus Christ, Caesar, Da Vinci, Tesla, Einstein, Newton, Aristotle, and many others. All of them died thinking they accomplished barely anything, or nothing at all. It is only years, CENTURIES later, that we begin to understand what they did for humanity. As such, Shingeki no Kyojin can not be appreciated by any of us, since we have many decades, orcenturies yet, to reach Hajime Isayama. What these men did on the fields of technology and etcetera, Isayama did for the culture and arts, forever immortalizing Eren Yeagers true patriotism, revenge AND FREEDOM. There is not a single doubt in my mind that Shingeki no Kyojin will stand the test of time, hanging in Louvre, and be studied in schools for centuries to come. Callling Shingeki no Kyojin an anime or a manga is an insult to it, as Shingeki no Kyojin is an ETERNAL, IMMORTAL PIECE OF ART. I was actually in doubt for a long time if I should even leave a review on “MyAnimeList”, as this is a general purpose “anime/manga” website. SnK is the La Gioconda of the 21st century. In other words, KINO beyond human understanding.

    ART 10

    I had my doubts with the studio change, as WiT wasn't perfect, but was more than enough. However, despite having CGI Titans and some funky rotoscope, Mappa proved they can, and will, provide nothing short of what Isayama intended, which is pure and perfect kinematographique. The scenes flow beautifully, they don't seem to be rushing anything important, minus the Annie scene from the invasion in manga, the colors are beautiful and actually fit with the manga, as WiT was a bit too colorful. Nothing more to say. I gave WiT a 10, and since they had its flaws, it’s only fair Mappa gets a 10 too.

    SOUND 10

    This is self explanatory, we have the same audio team as before, which was perfection. Sawano's name speaks for itself. That's all. Opening is amazing, ending is amazing. Easily the best opening song we got so far. Unfortunately, some casuals like to ruin art by shoehorning lyrics that are not there. The very noise of “My War” represents suffering in audio form, which needs no human lyrics. It is also very likely the OP is going to evolve, as experienced enjoyers can notice some subtle manga hints in the backgrounds of the opening.


    CHARACTERS 11

    Rating this just a 10 is a shame, since characters are what makes this anime great. Young warriors, especially Gabi, lack so much on so many fronts, and definitely bring a weird and unsavory taste in the later parts of manga. You will fairly soon realize that leaving Armin alive was a mistake, and for some reason, everyone except one character loses half of their IQ. So why did I give this section an 11? Because we still have this one man. One man who started as a victim of a senseless war he wanted no part of. Ever since that day, he swore revenge. And in Liberio, humanity got reminded. They lived in fear of the Usurper, and slowly awaited their massacre. Bravo Isayama. We also have Floch, who started out as a literally who, only to end up the best character of the manga, short of Eren. Every scene of his made me get up from my chair, and kneel to his patriotism. Floch-dono, you will NOT be forgotten. They have to keep moving forward, until their enemies are destroyed. Even if they die. Even after they die. Long live Eldia.

    ENJOYMENT 10

    I've been reading the manga since 2009. That's 11 years and 3 months I've spent most of my days studying and appreciating this masterpiece. From the first panel where Eren had a strange dream and posed some strange questions, I understood I was in for a far more wilder ride than I could ever think of. But I honestly can't advise everyone to watch/read it. As I said, this isn't an anime, nor a manga. This is art. And as some people will look at La Gioconda and only see a plain woman, most of the so called ""AoT fans” fall in that category. Unironically, Shingeki no Kyojin takes a very fine taste and high IQ to understand, so if you're an academic, a scholar with a fine taste, hop in and enjoy. It just might awaken something in you.

    OVERALL 10

There's nothing else to mention. All I can say is, praise the patriots, and hang the traitors. LONG LIVE THE GLORIOUS ELDIAN EMPIRE AND DEATH TO ITS ENEMIES.",2020-12-28T05:24:00+00:00,10
"Attack on Titan is probably one of the most overrated animes of all time, and to be honest, I had high expectations about this series. Before I continue, this review will cover the series from the first season to the fourth one, with few minor spoilers.I have to admit that the scenario and the atmosphere are pretty cool, you can feel the decadence of humanity, the empowerment of the soldiers when they want to achieve something, the desperation they have when they fail, and the epicness that the music has is incredible, all along with a great art style; the world is amazing, painstakingly detailed,and it doesn't feel just like a background.

Yes, the aesthetic is great... but everything else was disappointing.

The characters wobbled between a bad and a mediocre level of quality, their characterization is erratic, or they are directly so flat that it hurts, Mikasa, Levi, Sasha Blouse, Erwin Smith, etc, barely have any other personality trait beyond being an emo or an outgoing person, and some of them don't have a proper exploration of their motivations, despite they are relevant characters, we don't have a personal connection with them, ""the Titans killed their loved ones"" ok, but we don't know how good their relationship was, since we just ASSUMED they used to have a good relationship with their loved ones (acording to what they've told us)

Historia is a weird girl for multiple reasons, first, she claimed to be the ""Humanity's biggest enemy"" and then, she becomes the queen of the realm she supposedly hated, and she also decided that her life purpose will be to save everyone. Then we have Eren... Jesus Christ, he is the author's spoiled baby, there were so many moments when Eren should have died, but thanks to the magic of the plot armor, He survived! And don't forget that he's the carrier of a big superpower that makes him so special; you could say that this does not cause anything but a pain to him, but I can't believe that bullshit when the author is constantly saving him so deliberately in such epic ways over and over again.

Factor shock is the main characteristic this anime has, we had deaths of characters who we never met in-depth, or the best we've got from them was a flashback... minutes before they died, such a way to waste the potential of some interesting characters.

The anime stretched the main mystery to the top, either by some Diabolus ex Machina, such as the moment when Annie Leonhart got freeze or the amnesia Eren was carrying. There were so many moments when the great mystery could be solved, but the story decided to delay the big revelation, just to make the plot longer.

The political issues in the plot were... very stupid... I mean, the king was a useless asshole, and no, he wasn't a puppet, he literally was a retard who was sitting on the throne, just to feign he was the authority... and no one in the town had suspicions about him?... ok?

Anyway, I could spend hours and hours speaking on every single flaw this anime has, but my point is clear, this anime is shit 4/10",2020-12-28T10:41:00+00:00,4
"(TLDR Review at the bottom, as always, thanks for reading)最後の進撃が始まる。Attack On Titan. But is it an attack on titans now, or maybe a bigger enemy at hand?I'm sure AOT needs no introduction, it is that one anime that has spammed up everyone's YT recommendations with drip memes, Eren table scene memes, 10 hour fuck Gabi videos and her getting beat up,ｔｈｉｃｃｋａｓａ if you dived that deep into the culture. When the first episode of the final season came out, it was so powerful not even telling my dad for the Crunchyroll to work was possible. When I say this anime is something else in termsof internal and external events, I mean that this anime is something else. God knows when we are getting another community and anime like this ever again. I am glad I was here to experience this bit of the trek with others like myself and beyond.

I could go on and on about the moments shared. But I must write a review for now.


Narrative:
I may sound like a hardcore fanboy, but I am going to explain why I think this is a 10/10 narrative. I would also like to believe that people reading this review are aware of the references I will make to previous seasons. Ok cool. 

Starting off the final season, we get a bit of insight into the enemies on the other side of the sea. From initial impressions, it can be told that this nation, which uses children in warfare, is clearly lost in morale. And that is the slow building of this new true evil enemy of humanity, Marley. How AOT goes around building this empire of Marley is an interesting one. Marley has qualities of a fascist, imperialistic, tyrannical nation that can be converged to past real-life nations in human history. Those qualities don't just exist for the sake of it too, it is part of the long prejudice against Eldians, in which Marley exploits that to grow themselves and their dominance around the world. It is that which starts a whole chain of events. A serious chain. 

AOT FS story is focused on the cycle of hate, the consequences it has and the action people want to take due to it. Everything that has ever happened so far in the story from start to end (as of now) the cycle of hate continues to prevail in high life, all the while both sides suffer from nothing but losses. That is where the story really shines, the story plays two events on both sides of the spectrum, one we already know and love, Eren's side, and the other we are made to hate Gabi's side, it does a good job at making us hate Gabi's side of the story too, but when you look into it, who is wrong in this mindless loop of destruction? Both sides have given birth to a nation that seeks to exploit and dominate in an imperialistic fashion, the other gives birth to a literal bakemono, a Monster, the devil himself if you really want to go there. The story does a really good job of making those find more important questions. No one here's truly wrong because, in war, both sides believe in what they are doing to be the just cause of action. Both sides are deluded by their beliefs so much so that there isn't a spec of question as to if they might be ever so slightly wrong in their actions. Everyone becomes a victim of their surroundings. It is a fantastic way to really emphasize this world of AOT. From the start, it is clear that the hate got too many characters to the point of joining the army at a young age and leaders making up false stories for the sake of maintaining status. The world is cruel, and it sure as hell shows it here.

Characters are really something else in AOT. I want to first get rid of two characters that I found obviously flawed in the anime. Those two being Mikasa and Armin. In simple terms, the former is still a hardcore simp, the latter is still a hardcore weakling. How they don't change after all these years is beyond me. If Eren's drip game can go from 0 to 100, wouldn't it make sense his childhood friends caught on? But in all seriousness, I never quite understood the purpose of Mikasa and Armin. They are annoying, part of the reason I don't like them too much, but I acknowledge that annoying =/= bad character. The bad qualities of them should I say lie in what purpose they serve to the story as of the Final Season in my opinion. Mikasa has some benefit of the doubt given to her, she is starting to open up that Eren's apparent downfall is not one that wishes the best of him in his future, she even goes out of her way to question whether or not he is doing the right thing, but again, for the sake of the story, she needs to brainlessly be there for Eren even when my boy is committing various war crimes in the former Eldian empire. She was going places but easily lost herself due to a static character within her. Her ""development"", if you can even call it that, is a stretch in my opinion. She makes no effort to do anything she wouldn't normally do for a nice change in character, especially during these god awful times that both sides have faced. To be fair, Mikasa is supposed to be this life devoting girl to Eren because he saved her, but no development is absurd on quite a few levels, making her less of a believable character. Armin is still the same dude he was from the start, I honestly don't know why he too hasn't changed, actually, it would make sense that having the successor of human's greatest leader would feel like a burden, but all that time to train apparently meant nothing, well okay then. No development here to be pleased of.

Now, for the real MVPs. Eren. The dude is one of my favourite characters in the series, and not because he does an edgelord moment, but his change from the start to the end whilst still being consistent is quite satisfying and understandable to view. When Eren said he was gonna kill his enemies, he wasn't playing games. He did everything in his power to make that try and this season shows the beginning of such a change of heart.

Gabi. The annoying girl? But is she really? I remember when it was very easy to hate on Eren because of quite a similar personality, I was the same in that boat. Everything she does is justifiable despite being executed in a way to annoy the audience. Past the clouds and she isn't really any different from other characters like Eren. Hate grew on her, and she is fighting for the sake of the people she cares about, sounds a little bit like Eren does it not? Overall, I think Gabi is quite an interesting character, though, unlike Eren, she is portrayed on the wrong side of the story, giving her a different experience than Eren's life, the person she is most similar to. Her character plays out quite well if I am honest, the truth which she faces, later on, the reaction of which makes for a tragic life for Gabi honestly. Great writing overall for her.

Reiner. Gigachad hella swagger Reiner drip glow up. In seriousness, Reiner is one of the best characters in the series. He understands a lot more about the world and the harsh reality he has to face due to the brainwashing and control of Marley, he is a victim of the situation. A tragic one after what he has had to face during so. I feel quite bad for the dude but it goes to show like Gabi, he was part of the corrupted system which devalued his life so much that he was lost of everything.

Zeke is one I want to get a little into too, later on in the story he plays a big role in everything that goes down, but there is more than meets the eye with Zeke. you being to understand his motives a bit more and why he did the things he does, an intriguing monke, to say the least.

AOT uses a lot of explicit themes in the story to give it the acclamation it has, like revenge, hate, dystopia, but one of the more implicit themes to be shared is influence.    I have noticed that every character in AOT as a child has been influenced in some way. Eren with his past trauma growing into hatred, Gabi the same without the trauma, more like a duty. Reiner the same, but it is based on duty rather than anything else, Zeke would get into spoilers, but you will see what I mean when you get there. AOT does well at this and has made for more believable characters in the grand scale of things, past experiences will have a lot on what you say as you grow up. It also makes me think that on both a superficial and intramural level, the story has something to share regardless of how deep you dive into it. There aren't a lot of stories out there like this one. One of a kind honestly.


Audiovisuals:
The visuals are an iffy situation, I would be a liar to say I enjoyed the visuals all the way, but notes to take into account are, watch this at a minimum of 720p HD quality, and try to get used to the CGI early on. The CGI really got to me in particular but I got used to it in the end, it is quite unfortunate that Mappa had been given a really bad schedule, it was borderline impossible to make great sakuga all the way through, welcome to the anime industry where money is a top priority, but that's a story for another time. I understand that there wasn't any substantial time for Mappa to even make 10/10 animation, but it doesn't excuse the fact that this isn't the best thing in the world. It isn't. So I didn't see this as anything of glory for the most part, however, even with a bs schedule, Mappa did actually have quite a bit of moment where there were just great scenes overall, their 2D animation and was still amazing to hold onto the tragic reality Mappa faced. They also have amazing camera work, which made most scenes that much more impactful. I could name a few but they would go into spoilers. This is a tragic category, but it is one that I still found some goodness in. 

I have been meaning to only give 10/10 audio to only Clannad's OST, but that changes today, not that numbers meant much to begin with, but you know. AOT FS doesn't suffer from any kind of lack in the soundtrack to the point where innovation is needed, it also has a wide range of sounds that feature more or less anything that produces a sound, basically, this has it all, the great sound is clearly prominent in this series and has clearly shown that these pieces were composed. So many great tracks to remember, be it due to controversy or just the hype surrounding the said OST brings. OP and ED are in the same boat, I can't say both tracks have left my head at all and on the visuals side of things they are completely memorable and original. Amazing sounds. Nothing less. I also need to talk about the seiyuus because they did an outstanding performance, it is burnt into the memory of how well they performed, generally amazing on everyone's side. You won't see acting like this in a good while I tell you, endorse it now whilst it is still there.


Enjoyment:
There are a lot of things very enjoyable about AOT FS. Most of mine comes from an external experience, in talking to fans about the philosophy of the characters, what might be upcoming and which side are you on. You can do this with yourself internally too, it depends on how you look at it really. Universal enjoyment is really what I just said, mostly about asking yourself the different questions this has to offer, there is no wrong answer which makes it all the more interesting. Random theories come out of nowhere but they could hold water. Is all fair in war? At the end of the day, AOT allows you to build your own enjoyment of what it gives to you. 

Other side factors directly within the anime include hype moments and fight scenes you are just dying for. Whilst they aren't the best, they are still extremely good and something that I find myself looking forward to at times. AOT needs to have its action here and there to satisfy both parties I guess. In saying that, I do have to point out that a lot of people get a bit bored with the slowness of episodes containing no action and serving as plot-based episodes, I would agree slightly, but it is the same slow journey that is worth the while. You just need to prevail. All in all, AOT does a good job of allowing everyone to enjoy themselves. There's something for all in this gem.


Overall - 9.6 (10)
----------

TLDR Review:
Story - 10: Philosophical questions, political troubles, generally very intriguing story to find yourself immersed in.
Visuals - 9: Yes the CGI isn't the best, but it is actually used quite well, 2D animation still amazing and
Audio - 10: Amazing OST, OP,  ED and seiyuus. It is one of a kind here.
Characters -  9.5: Slight hiccup in a few characters, everyone else
Enjoyment - 9.5: Very minor complaint, sometimes episodes are less intriguing than others, but most of the time the hype is still there and this is something to look forward to.

Overall - 9.6 (10)

Before I cut this review off, I really want to put out there this amazing things have gone down with everything in relation to AOT, good or bad, these events were something to witness, getting a following like this again for new manga, which will eventually turn into popular manga, into anime, into popular anime, into a global success, doesn't seem like it will happen anytime soon. I am glad I was here when this season aired, experiencing all the events that went down lol. Truly monumental moment.",2021-03-28T08:38:00+00:00,10
"(SLIGHT SPOILERS FOR SHINGEKI NO KYOJIN AHEAD, WATCH THE OTHER SEASONS BEFORE READING!!!!!!)Attack on Titan has been renowned throughout the years as one of the greatest anime to come out of the 2010's with its massive fanbase and incredible hype, and it's easy to see why. It's gory, it's a shonen with a somewhat unique plot, typical shonen main character and a hot side character and the great animation combined with great sound. However much i hate this series, i always praised it for some great scenes with animation and music that was unmatched by other anime. Season 4 of attack on titan lost thosetwo things that made it somewhat enjoyable to watch.

Story: 5/10
First of all, the battle between marley and the mid east allied forces here makes no sense and isn't explained further but we will let it slide since it doesn't really matter. I don't care how important all of this talking is, but i didn't come here to see these people talking about who will be the sucsessor to whatever titan. It's a snoozefest, and the few action scenes we get to see are really short and boring. In classic AOT fashion, it shows the viewers some extremely long dialogue and utterly boring conversations between chracters that seems somehwat important but really is just there to make us think this story is deep. Absolute trash, the only reason it's getting hype is because of the fangirls losing their minds and soaking their pants because they saw Zeke smoking a cigarette. The incredibly mediocre story of the show has just gotten worse, turning in to some boring trash garbage. 

Art: 2/10
This is the worst part about the anime. The only reason it gets two points is because it is a little more accurate to the manga compared to the previous seasons, but it's still awful. MAPPA obviously don't give a shit about the animation and decided to ruin the one thing attack on titan had going for it with terrible cgi that is hard to look at. Even during scenes with no action, the charatcers seem loose and move like an abnormal titan. The animation quality has dropped lower than my balls did. The armored titan looks like a big piece of meat covered with wood combined with iron mans eyes and the beast titan has a body 10x bigger than it's head, looking idiotic. It's like replacing Godzilla's head with Donkey Kong's left nut. As bad as the titan's look, young Reiner looks a bit less dumb now which is a plus. If it's this bad already, how are they plannng on making the Warhammer Titan look remotely good? The later parts of the series are going to be hard to animate and it seems like this series is doomed. MAPPA are concentrating on Jujutsu Midkaisen it seems. Attack On Titan fans lying to themselves trying to tell themselves that the animation is good is like Playboi Carti fans in denial after Whole Lotta Trash forcing themselves to like it, in denial. 

Sound: 5/10
What the fuck happened to the banger openings this anime had? Guren no Yumiya was a 10/10 opening, Sasageyo was a banger and every other openign was decent too. Now instead we have someone just singing gibberish with visuals that look like a 2020 gender reveal. One thing is for sure, the opneing reflects on how absolutely trash this series is. The overall sound in the other scenes is decent, but not as good anymore. Very dissapointing. 

Character: 3/10
What is there to even say about this. Eren went from a crybaby to a homeless man trying to sound cool with his wise words which just turn out to sound cringe considering this is the kid who was screaming non stop in season 1. Reiner is on the verge of killing himself which is completely his fault. Shouldn't have chosen that path buddy. And now to the new ones, Gabi is a dumb kid who just gets lucky during battle. Falco is probably even dumber; ""I just want to protect you Gabi, that's why i'm ruining your dreams and taking the titan from you so my family can be honorary marleyan and yours can be devil eldians!"". Pieck is possibly the most overrated girl in this series, she looks like a zombie and is almost as ugly as her titan. She hasn't done anything other than trying to look cute. Why is she getting hype? Horny 14 year old fanboys that have never felt the warmth of a woman. Everyone else is the same. Zeke is the best character in the series but so far he hasn't done anything than smoke a cigarette.

Enjoyment: 3/10
This season is so boring i'd rather watch paint dry or even try to read the Dragon Ball manga without getting a stroke. Seriously, all this dialogue is just making me hungry. After the episode is over, I feel like I got nothing from it. Nothing new happened and we move on to re-read a chapter of Berserk aka peak fiction. Trash anime.

Overall: 3 pity points/10",2021-01-03T06:08:00+00:00,3
"Well Guys this is my very first review, I wanted to start reviewing this show as soon as it comes. I'm a loyal SnK anime fan, I somehow managed to keep myself from reading the Damn Manga and avoid (maximum) spoilers. When I heared that WIT Studio is no more animating the series, I was really afraid of a sequel that's gonna end up like Nanatsu no Taizai by studio Deen, But when They announced that the final season will be released by MAPPA I was kinda relieved. Even if they changed the original character design to make it resemble more to Isayama's Artstyle.-The firstepisode which aired last week carried a lot of surprises ; including the new OP and ED where there is no more hyping stuff like SASAGEYO SASAGEYO. Also the CGI titans were not very pleasant to see, that's my personal opinion.
-The second Episode showed us The MAPPA Potential. The color Grading was good, The 2D animations were smooth and stuff... I'm still waiting to hear something from SAWANO since he participated in the composition of OSTs. Also there was one thing that I am sure everyone noticed ; The flashbacks taken directly from previous WIT Studio episodes ... damn I nearly cried when I saw them. To be honest I think that it was the best option to take. They will have more time to animate other scenes where I hope ther would be less CGI and more SAKUGA. The one ARIFUMI IMAI always gave us.
So this is it for the moment after only 2 episodes, I have after all to thank the new studio for giving us a sequel in 2020 as scheduled at the end of season 3 pt 2 regardless of the pandemic and their overwork this year; Jujutsu Kaisen ... GOH ...",2020-12-27T13:51:00+00:00,9
"To think that season one of Attack on Titan aired in 2013, and that I have had the pleasure of following the series since that time is something that makes me feel a great amount of pride. We've witnessed the armored and colossal titan destroy the walls of Paradis in season one, and now the same people that suffered at the hands of Marley are the ones on the offensive. In season three, the world went from 3 walls and a vast nothingness to advanced civilizations and mind-bending revelations. Looking back, it feels as though the aims of the Survery Corps were ultimately meaningless, andthis shift of perspective we were given is extremely thought-provoking.  

Instead of titans being the main enemy, humanity faces war within itself. Showing life from the viewpoint of Marley is refreshing, and I can't help but wonder if we would be rooting for these guys if the series had been about them from the start. Despite this, in the first episode, we see a familiar person in Marley, showing that the Survey Corps has already infiltrated during the time skip between seasons 3 and 4. I know that there are still many truths to be revealed in this season. Will the Eldians end up on top? Who will control the power of each titan in the end? 

I am so excited to see the end of this season, but I am also saddened that this will mark the final release for this series. If you are considering watching this anime, what are you waiting for?! If you don't trust my word, at least trust the ratings of over 70k viewers that have given a combined score of 9.06/10.",2020-12-27T14:30:00+00:00,10
"Oh boy, Attack On Titan is on it’s final stages. This time with a new Studio, and that Studio is MAPPA. Well let’s get straight to the review.Keep in mind that this will be a review from a manga reader(tho I haven’t finished it)Story: It’s Attack On Titan, need i say more? Well, i’ll say more. Attack on Titan’s story is like no other. It can either have you on the edge of your seat, or can make you die of a heart attack due to the amount of shock factor this show has(i mean this in a good way) Attack On Titan’s story notonly is able to play with your feelings while your eyes are glued to the screen, but can also make us think about how cruel humanity really is.

 Now, i don’t know if it was just me, but after the first 4 eps and the rest of the manga. I really started to question,”how this story will get better?” “How it can top itself again?” But each chapter makes the previous ones look like filler. It’s just that good. All in all AoT’s story is a very fleshed out story and well thought out. You can tell Isayama really planned ahead. (10/10)



Characters:

Eren Yeager(20/10)


Music:

Horrible, jkjk

It’s done by the man himself, Hiroyuki Sawano. This guy has turned AoT into a different being on itself. He turned AoT from a King to a fucking God. That’s how good the music is.

 Everytime the music plays, i’m just in awe on how fitting it is. It gives off emotion and perfectly fits the atmosphere of the scene. Reiner and Bertholdt’s reveal would’ve been not as good as it was without that OST. I could go on and on and on on how good the music in AoT is(especially in Episode 3 Season 4) but i don’t got all day, and my thumbs have a limit xd(100/10)


Animation and Art:

Oh, we’re finally here. Now, before you kill me. No, i don’t hate MAPPA, not even close. In-fact, most of my first anime’s are done by MAPPA. But holy shit THE FUCKING BLUR. Now, the blur only bothers me when it’s bright and even then it doesn’t bother me much. But the blur is getting out of hand. I wouldn’t be surprised if we would just be looking at a blurry screen by episode 10.

Ok, i’ve ranted enough. Now i’m gonna talk about the good in their animation.

The character movement. Though the animation in Episode 2 was a little laggy. It was filled with movement. A dialogue episode. With movement. WHAT? That’s a rare case. People who call MAPPA lazy need to stfu. Because damn MOVEMENT IN A FUCKING DIALOGUE EPISODE.


Now we get to the fight scenes(Episode 1)

“oMg cGi horRiblE fiNAl sEasOn rUineD!1!1!1!1”

I hear this everywhere, and i sometimes wonder if they even know what “bad cgi” is. The CGI was amazing(aside from Monke fuck that) They managed to blend it in 90% time, hell I didn’t even know it WAS CGI until the MaL fans were complaining.

I hope we get this consistent quality in the future EPS because it 👏 is 👏 amazing 👏 (9/10)


Enjoyment:

Overall I enjoyed the first 4 EPS and hope i will enjoy it as much in future eps.
(10/10)

Pretty Good season so far and i have faith it will get better. Bye 👋",2020-12-27T23:56:00+00:00,10
"This is one of the masterpiece anime ever made, has the best storyline and the song is very epico.character development can also be said to be very good in its execution. I have no problem with CGI like other people say, in fact, I think it's good. and the character design is also attractive and creates a deep impressionThe opening song is also very suitable in my opinion with the war atmosphere that will occur later in the season finale, where people don't even like the reason that the opening filler is not linked Horzon, but in my opinion it doesn't matterso overall this animeis one of the mastepiece anime ever made",2020-12-29T11:24:00+00:00,10
"[manga reference, no spoils] It took 7 years to get were we are now, we saw those three kids grow up, we saw them fighting for justice for humanity, we saw them losing friends, family, suffering and keeping moving forward with the hope one day they would kill all the titans, we thought they were fighting the enemy of humanity but now, after 7 years everything is fuckedThis anime doesn't look like it will have those types of finals that leaves a feeling on you of enjoyment, this is now a tragedy and I doubt it will have a ""happy"" ending We were watching thisseries hoping that one day we could see Eren kill the last titan on earth, the ending we wanted is now impossible and there's nothing they can do, there isn't a right side anymore, you just watch from all sides and.. feel bad for everything, no matter what side you pick you will just feel bad.

This Anime is a Tragedy and it's everything we hoped wouldn't happen, most animes try to give that sense of satisfaction when you get to the end, this seems to be the exact contrary, you will feel like you watched the story of these people rise just for at the end everything going tumbling down

This opening isn't close to show how sad this last season will possibly be 

Story 10/10

When we started watching this show we never thought it could ever turn into this type of war anime, the author really did a good job of creating this story and the way he guided us throw the years to this point was really good

Art 8.5/10

Could always be better but it's good enough for this type of anime, my problem here is MAPPA, I don't really like their CGI, it's too noticeable and out of place unlike Wit 

Sound 10/10 I don't have to explain 

Characters 10/10 

Unlike previous season this time the characters are very well written, it even looks like the characters were ""shit"" before just to give them this development now 

Enjoyment 1/10 or 10/10 

It does a perfect job of making me feel shit so idk if that's a 1 or a 10

"Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyojin, a name which is very popular among fellow Anime watchers.Originally written by Hajime Isayama, this story never fails to impress us.Story: It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that this is the best story ever written. Everything in the story connects very well. The best thing about this is how it touches every aspect like religion, freedom, slavery, murder, will, and order.Character: Every Character in this story is so good and plays a significant role. It is literally impossible to say who is good and who is bad because of how things differ from everyone's perspective.Art: The Animationquality is awesome, they did great considering that they were tough on time. (Thanks Mappa for taking it.)
Enjoyment: It's awesome but can't say that someone will enjoy considering how tragic the story is. This story is a roller-coaster of sadness and depression.

Appreciation for the Writer.
Hajime Isayama, Writer and Illustrator of AoT Manga is a genius person. The more I get into the story, the more I realized that He thought of everything from the start.",2020-12-27T14:55:00+00:00,10
"Attack on Titan: The Final Season is an ambitious project. Here we have the culmination of years worth of meticulous planning, foreshadowing and build-up. The narrative apex of what started out as a fairly straightforward survival story, now an intricate weaving of political drama, social commentary and grandiose action setpieces, with the best yet to come. To pull off a story of such epic scale on animation is not an easy task. Adaptations of the sort often struggle with several difficulties even getting off the ground, let alone actually doing justice to the source material. AOT has been blessed in this regard by an adaptationthat while not the most technically accomplished or smooth in terms of production, has remained consistently great thanks to its commitment to a strong artistic vision, incredible soundtrack and a genuine attempt at adhering to and properly conveying the events of its source material as well as it can. Not only did it do the manga justice, it often elevated scenes to another level thanks to the sheer strenght of its presentation. Shingeki fans are luckier than most.

Momentum seemed to be in AOT's favor as we entered the most hyped up season of the show since its heyday back in season 1. Many fans were worried about the studio change at first, but also optimistic when it was revealed that MAPPA would be Wit’s replacement. 16 episodes later, I can confidently say that we got another strong adaptation on our hands, but not one without compromises or a fair share of vocal detractors and controversies. With a change of creative leads comes a different vision, so even if this season was produced under ideal circumstances, which it definitively was not, the difference in flair alone would’ve been enough to divide opinions. 

So in order to understand the full breadth of the situation, I will attempt to assess the oft-discussed schism between MAPPA and Wit, how their approaches differ, and then give my own thoughts on this season as a whole. As such, we need to first contextualize the circumstances surrounding the final season.

==THE PRODUCTION==

AOT S1 was an effort of showmanship by then newcomer Wit Studio. Director Tetsuro Araki of Death Note fame, coming fresh off the heels of Highschool of the Dead and Guilty Crown, sought to form a team that would be up to the task of delivering the most bombastic and impressive action show they could make. From the gound up, it was meant to be Wit’s bold proclamation to the anime industry and fans around the world: we’re here and this is what we can do. Numerous as their production issues would end up being, and the staff nearly did almost collapse under the workload, they undeniably delivered a final product that all parties involved could be proud of.

Season 4, on the other hand, is a bit of a different beast on a conceptual and philosophical level. It’s no industry secret that it had to deal with a tumultuous schedule. The team was hastily put together by getting everyone who was available at the time, which is the reason this season was particularly low on star animators and action directors when compared to previous outings. Not by the fault of director Yuuichirou Hayashi either, who’s just as capable at his job as Araki, but simply because the cimrcunstances surrounding the production wouldn’t allow for anything better. Rather than a showcase of the team’s full capabilities or a passion project, this was more about finishing off the job of another studio while trying to please the fans. I don’t mean this as a knock on the team at all, one can only imagine how daunting the pressure must’ve been, but it’s important to point out these distinctions. The fact that the final product turned out as good as it did, warts and all, is nothing short of a testament to the staff's incredible ability of making the best out of an awful situation. Nevertheless, the cracks do show and they only become more apparent the further we get into the final season.

To take over the work of an accomplished team is a difficult proposition in itself, even moreso when said work is already extremely difficult to translate to an animated medium *and* has a history of hellish production cycles. To do so under turbulent circumstances, while needing to start from scratch, was bound to cause controversies. 

Though impressively enough, things started out pretty well for S4. There were the usual complaints about CGI and cut content here and there, but for the most part people seemed excited. That wouldn’t last when we got the first batch of episodes to “not live up” to expectations, resulting in assholes harassing the staff at social media. Sometimes even directors and animators who had nothing to do with the episodes said assholes had a gripe with in the first place. It was an embarassing situation all around.

This eventually led to a state of affairs where fans of the season became perhaps too defensive at any criticism aimed at it while the more vocal detractors used it as an opportunity to lash out at the series in general. Amidst the harassment, the terrible schedule, the hyperbolic negativity masquerading as critique, insane amounts of trolling, and the fans and haters shouting at each other increasingly louder… Well, it became somewhat difficult to discuss this season's shortcomings in a level headed manner.

To make matters worse, well intentioned fans pivoted to singing praises to MAPPA (#thankyoumappa trended on twitter) when they shouldn’t have. Praise the hard working staff, absolutely, they deserve it, but don’t validate MAPPA’s recklessness. Hardheaded as AOT's production committee may be, at the end of the day it was MAPPA who decided to take on such a huge project at the expense of their employees' wellbeing. When literally every other studio was sane enough to decline the absurd schedule imposed by Kodansha, even WIT Studio themselves, it was MAPPA who chose to throw their artists under the bus over prestige. It’s not the first time they’ve commited to more projects than they can reasonably handle either. Sure, they couldn’t have predicted the pandemic, but the schedule was already terrible even when not accounting for that. To defend them is to defend the anime industry's worst practices against its creators. Acknowledge their guilt if you want better for everyone involved.

As a result, this season was a mixed bag in technical terms. A lot of attention has been drawn to the CGI titans which are, quite frankly, the one aspect the show handled the best. Most of them look very good and are well integrated within the anime’s visual style. They move well during action scenes and are animated in a way so as to mimick 2D movement, implementing techniques like frame skipping. Even the weaker ones like the Beast Titan are still considerably better than WIT Studio's attempts at CGI titans during seasons 2 and 3, which always looked jarring and out of place. This is one of the more frustrating aspects about the anime community: no matter how sensible their implementation or how good they look, people will still shit on 3D animation by the simple virtue that it isn’t 2D animation.

What concerns me more is how bad the show can look some of the time. This season just isn’t as aesthetically beautiful as the previous ones, and it does not animate more fluidly to compensate either. There is an overreliance on bloom, chromatic aberration and other postprocessing effects, likely as a crutch to maintain a sense of visual consistency throughout the season. While that works well enough most of the time, it can just as often look like a blurry mess, specially during the latter half of the show. Flashbacks to previous seasons are smeared with effects to mask the shift in art style. Some of the compositing looks ugly. The colors either feel too muted or too overblown depending on the lighting. This is not to say the show can't look beautiful at times, and it does rely on good storyboarding to carry itself, but it never quite reaches the beauty of previous seasons or the full potential hinted at by the pre-release trailer. Some argue that MAPPA handles dialogue better, but aside from some Marley arc episodes the dialogue scenes in the Paradis arc are just as stiff if not more than WIT’s.

Finally, the biggest loss of them all come in the form of the ODM gear sequences. These used to be among the most impressive visual displays of seasons past, full of fluid and dynamic camera shots mixing 2D and 3D animation. These are when the action animation directors really got to flex their muscles in their attempts to one-up each other, constantly pushing the envelope of what they were capable of. All of that is gone. ODM scenes now look extremely stiff and don't even attempt to mimick that same feeling of wild momentum. Even Levi, the show's favorite sasuga poster boy, didn't get a trademark jaw-dropping scene during what is likely to be his last big hurrah. Granted, it was always going to be difficult to follow up on Imai. The man wrote the book on how AOT’s action should look like and inspired his co-workers to follow on his footsteps. To match that while having to start your workflow from zero, without any of the specialists who had been building that skillset over the years, is a herculean task. But given more time I’ve no doubt the current staff could’ve done a much better job than what we got.

I am sure that the consequences of the show's hurried schedule spread much deeper within the season's DNA than just its technical aspects. Less production time means less time for composing new music, rushed creative decisions, important scenes not receiving the priority they deserve, wonky transitions and pacing not getting corrected, and so on. 

As a result, S4 feels consistent but rarely exceptional when it comes to delivering memorable moments. While it sometimes elevates the source material, it just as often struggles to not crumble under its weight. It can be argued that MAPPA’s lows aren’t as low as Wit’s, but they never really come close to matching their highs either.

==A DIFFERENT APPROACH==

So, all right, the season had exceptionally bad production problems. So what? I hear you asking. Just another day for the survey corps. Season 3 Part 2 had a fucked up schedule too and everyone loved it! This is true, though having a team who is already familiar with the material and has years of experience to fall back on makes all the difference. However, not all can be waved away under the umbrella of “production issues”. This is when we start getting into the more subjective aspects of this analysis that not everyone is going to see eye to eye with.

Tetsurou Araki and Yuuchirou Hayashi are fundamentally different directors with their own sets of strengths, so it should be no surprise that their approaches to Attack on Titan are very different. Araki sports a boisterous style through and through, always aiming for bigger, faster and louder. Even in an anime about people writing on goddamn notebooks, he imbues it with such grandiosity and a kinetic energy that you rarely see matched elsewhere. A match made in heaven for Attack on Titan’s larger than life narrative, specially during those first few arcs more reliant on spectacle. It was that energy and confidence that fueled the first three seasons of Attack on Titan and made it such a tour de force that delivered its most iconic moments with gusto. Like his style or not, Araki delivered his scenes with such blaring confidence and pizazz that you couldn’t help but be swept away by his thunderstorm of emotions.

Hayashi, on the other hand, takes a more understated approach to this season. I can’t say I am as familiar with the guy’s work so I have no idea if that’s just his signature or not, but it isn’t a bad match for AOT either. With the time-skip marking a significant shift in tone for the story, a more grounded style of presentation works well for the chapters covered here. Many people have described this season as feeling more like a “war movie”, and I can totally see what they mean by that. There’s this grounded grittyness to how Hayashi conveys the world of AOT.

I can’t claim to be unbiased here. I loved Wit Studio and Araki’s “voice” for Attack on Titan and I was sad to see them go. It’s hard not to grow attached after so many years. Given the choice, I would pick them to animate S4P2 in a heartbeat. A part of me can’t help but wonder how certain scenes would’ve panned out with them in the driver’s seat. Would the low points be lower, but the highs much higher? Or were those highs impossible to achieve given the circumstances? How much can we chalk up to schedule, and how much to deliberate creative choices? One can only guess. 

A lot has already been discussed about the changes and when all is said and done it all boils down to preference. I’m not here to tell you how you should feel about either team, nor am I attempting to offer some faux-objectivist breakdown on who is better. I’ve just laid the facts and shared my views on the matter, you’re free to agree or disagree.

All that said, Hayashi and his staff have every right to be proud of their work here. Henceforth, I will be judging them entirely on their own achievements from now on. Wit Studio can take a bow, they’ve more than earned it. 

Be aware that if you’re reading this review prior to watching the season, the next 2 sections will contain spoilers for the arcs they cover. Skip to Final Thoughts if you wish.

==THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN==

The first few episodes of Attack on Titan: The Final Season do a fantastic job at setting the tone for the remainder of the show. More than any of the previous seasons, this feels like a war drama. While Titans are undoubtedly still the engine driving the main conflict, they take a bit of a backseat to the characters and the world they inhabit.

Reiner’s character study during these first few episodes is perhaps the strongest character arc this season has to offer as he fills the role of the protagonist. His journey from big bro side character on S1, to antagonist in S2 and 3, to a deeply troubled and conflicted individual in S4 makes him one of the show’s stand-out characters to me. May his plot armor live long after the heat death of the universe, carrying all of our guilt and sins into the eternal void of space.

While being significantly more slow paced than we’re used to, these first few episodes do a great job at slowly raising the tension as they progress. We are introduced to a whole new cast, setting and plot developments. The season’s more muted visuals actually work in its favor during this particular section of the story. There’s this foreboding atmosphere permeating every shot, a slow but steep climb of unease that signals something big is about to go off. No other episode encapsulates these feelings better than the first big turning point of the season: Declaration of War.

Much has already been said about Declaration of War than I could possibly do justice during a series review. It is a masterful display on how to build tension and pacing, ultimately culminating in one of the AOT’s most defining moments. While I firmly believe the climax could’ve been done much better for multiple reasons (yes, poor ost choice being one of them, but not the only), it still stands as one of the best episodes the series has to offer. 

Marley’s climax only solidifies its greatness further by following up with The WarHammer Titan and Assault, the latter in particular being one of the series’ best action focused episodes yet, and finally concluding with Assassin’s Bullet, a hell of a gut punch to end this first half of this season. For better or worse, this is also when S4 peaks.

==AND HIS NAME IS...==

Paradis comprises the second half of the season and is when the show starts to feel a little less polished. The animation is rougher, there are more stills and you can definitely feel the production starting to take its toll. Luckily enough, this section of the story is mostly focused on dialogue so these issues don’t negatively impact the show as much as they otherwise would. They do, unfortunately, remain noticeable until the end.

Eren is the other stand-out character this season and the conflicts in this arc are entirely driven by him. Characters discuss and are motivated to act for or against him. Marley and War For Paradis marks a definitive turning point for his character from a reactive protagonist to an active force of change, an unstoppable agent of freedom. He becomes a fascinating character to watch as you never know exactly what he is thinking or what his true intentions are, arguably transitioning to the role of an anti-hero, villain protagonist or straight up antagonist depending on who you ask. His arc, alongside most other elements set-up during these episodes, unfortunately won’t see any pay-off until part 2 airs, so I won’t go into much detail.

The biggest flaw of this arc and what ultimately holds this season back from living up to all it could be is that it ends just as things are about to hit their climax. The finale feels like any other regular episode and is definitely the least fullfilling one we’ve had so far. There is no resolution, just a big cocktease of a “to be continued”. It’s for the better considering the following events could not be done justice under the current schedule, but it still stings.

Incomplete as it is, there are still some stand-out moments to be found here, from Gabi’s continued growth as a character leading to the confrontation at the restaurant, to Eren, Armin and Mikasa’s table scene, to Zeke’s flashback episode. YMMV on whether Levi vs Beast Titan round 2 stands among the greats or not as it is when you can most strongly feel the strains of this production with its jerky movements and unpolished feel due to a lack of in-betweens (and it’s not the only scene who suffers from this). I personally think they did a pretty good job all things considered and I’ll defend the use of K21 till my very last breath.

==FINAL THOUGHTS==

I watched Attack on Titan back when it first aired in 2013. Episode 1 enraptured me in a way few anime premieres have done before or since. Whilst season 1 ultimately lacked in certain areas I thought were crucial for a story to truly carve its place among the greats, it was still a pretty cool action-horror thrill ride with a novel gimmick that left an impression on me. Maybe “too hyped up”, but frankly who gives a shit as long as you have a good time. 

I was excited at the prospect of a season 2 and anxiously waited for its announcement. Somewhere along the 4 years it took, I experienced other stories, found new hobbies and was at a completely different headspace than back when that first season aired. My interest had naturally declined and I believed myself to be over such a “basic” series. Season 2 came and went with some amount of fanfare but nowhere near as much as its predecessor, and so it was easy to ignore.

Fast-forward to 2019 and I see the latest season of AOT carving its way up to MAL’s top 10. It got me curious but I briefly dismissed it as fanboy fervor. All the while, however, I kept hearing whispers. “Attack on Titan is actually really fucking good right now”, they said. “It’s almost like a completely different show now”, they proclaimed. “They revealed what’s in the basement”. All right, fine. I got curious enough to bite. I read the equivalent of season 1 through the manga in order to refresh my memory, laughed at the wonky art, and then jumped straight to season 2. I enjoyed it a bit more than I thought I would. Perhaps I had underestimated AOT after all. Season 3 had a few weak spots but somewhere along the way I found myself invested in those characters I previously didn’t care about. S3P2 exceeded all my expectations. I was a follower of Ymir once again and quickly switched to the manga. And now, a year and change later, here we are.

When it comes down to it, I greatly enjoyed my time with Attack on Titan: The Final Season. It is by no means perfect. Its assortment of flaws are what stops me from giving it a higher score, and I would be lying if I said I’m not at least a bit disappointed at what could’ve been, but by no means does that make what we got bad. I’ve been waiting with bated breath to see some of these chapters adapted and for the most part they delivered. 

Those “certain areas” in which I thought AOT lacked all the way back in season 1 have been fully addressed at this point. This is the strongest the series has ever been in terms of writing and characters and it hasn’t even peaked yet. Even with everything stacked against them, director Yuuchirou Hayashi and his team stood up to the challenge and delivered something that, while lacking those same singular highs of the past, can proudly stand shoulder to shoulder among its peers. We got another quality adaptation when, by all means, this had all the ingredients of an unmitigated disaster.

With the announcement that we’ll be getting part 2 this winter, I remain skeptical about whether this is a healthy schedule to deliver what are going to be by far the most resource intensive, difficult to adapt chapters of the entire show. I really don’t see why the rush to get this out the door when the manga is about to end and the hype is still going. At any case, here’s hoping for the best so we can finish this journey off with a bang.

There is no “greatest anime of all time”. Not AOT, not FMA, not LOGH, not S;G, not HxH, not OP, not any of the animes in the entire top 100. There is no single “greatest anything of all time” across any artistic medium for that matter. For all the bickering, screaming and smug elitist posturing of every fanbase who deems themselves worthier than the other, the truth is the entirety of a medium’s richness cannot be properly distilled into a single work. You can have your favorite(s), but to proclaim it the greatest is haughty at best. There will never be a consensus on that, and it would be boring if it did. Even within individual genres there will be plenty of disagreements. What we do have, nonetheless, is a canon of works of exemplary quality whose legacy endures throughout the years. Those are the stories that stand the test of time, the classics, mainstream or cult. As it is, I can say I wholeheartedly believe AOT belongs to that group of exceptional anime. Regardless of how it ends, it has already delivered a narrative with more pathos than most.",2021-03-28T08:52:00+00:00,9
"Attack On Titan is probaly one of the biggest anime out there besides Death Note or Naruto. And this season will be the end of the anime. Its sad indeed but what do I think of the first four episodes and is it still as good as the other seasons?Or better?-Story-I have read the manga from chapter 93 to 135. The reason i didnt include on my manga list is because I havent read the entire manga yet and that is cheating.The new episodes of season 4 are mostly build-up for the next extreme arcs out there that will probaly blow up the internet. Butlets talk about the episodes one by one...

Episode 1

This was just full out battle and fights left and right, at first its confusing but later everything became a lot more clear. Most people were complaining about the CGI of the Titans, i didnt have that big of a problem exept the beast titan.(at least he looks better then that weird AOT game)

Episode 2

This episode was diaolouge heavy(sorry for bad english) and mostly gave us more depth to the new cast of characters and told also alot more about reiner and how broken he is from the inside, even tough he's called the armoured Titan(ironic). And also people didnt like this episode because of the weird movements(I didnt care)

Episode 3

This episode gave us new information about how Reiner and Bertholt and Annie operated. It was really intresting. Sadly they did cut some scenes but I dont think its that important. This episode was defenitly a lot darker then the others but still verry good....

Episode 4

This episode feels like filler but at the same time, not as much. Side Characters were given a lot more screentime and the entire AOT community is horny because of the scene they added. And the ending was a really amazing ending to end the episode..And now there is HYPE!

Art
No complaints, Mappa did a great job. I would say its better then Wits Style(my opinion)

Sound
Really like the new themes. And ""My War"" is now my 3rd favorite AOT op. But the ending in my opinion is good.

Enjoyment

I could have enjoyed this a lot more if f--king Manga readers didnt say shit, like ccom man seriously let other people enjoy the Story....

Overall

For now I will give it an 8. I liked it alot but my enjoyment was pretty much ruined by Manga readers. Because of them I also read the manga so I could be immume to them. Sadly they will always spoil:(...

Have a nice year, hopefully 2021 will be better",2020-12-29T12:42:00+00:00,8
"Attack on titan season 4 is on its fourth episode so my opinion can change.So far I feel as if the season is following the source material the manga pretty well.It just depends how well Mappa can pull it off since the 3D titans are throwing people off.On the other hand though season 4 accelerates to a whole other level and there's a lot of new characters and good story which introuduces more understanding on titans, the rest of the world, and Erens new goal.Though it starts off with a 4 year time skip in which a lot has changed (in my opinion for thebetter of the story) , but I'd reccomend rewatching some parts of the show.Overall so far I'm giving it an 8.5 and round that to a 9.",2020-12-27T16:13:00+00:00,9
"Do you remember the last time you saw such a big hype with an anime, other than Shingeki no Kyojin? Not??? Well, I ask you to sit down, relax and watch, because I will tell you this little story, this little theater, about how AoT became one of the most renowned and commented animes of all time.Since 2009, when the manga was first published, in the amateur Bessatsu Shounen Magazine, until 2021, there were 12 long years of difficulties in the construction of this beautiful story, which brings together many characters. Hajime Isayama is the main one, obviously. He was so new as a mangaka,that his relevance as a story creator was something sudden, nobody expected that a show in which humanity is constantly challenged and subdued would be really popular, especially with an always constant quality. Wit Studio was also another important character for AoT. It couldn't be any studio, the show should be more careful from the beginning. And that's what happened. In 2013, we have the first anime, a boom in what was known by hype. Seasons 2 and 3 have been completed and the studio has now been changed. It is now in the hands of MAPPA. But did it work?

""Is AoT going to overcome another difficulty? This season is the last one, there is no way not to be euphoric"" ~ Really, these are questions that have always had the essence of this show. Shingeki no Kyojin has never been a great experience without having had very high efforts from your staff.

First, we have the Eldians (or the group focused on Paradis), the ""demons"", for the Marleyans. It is not without reason that the Marleyans adopt this nickname for the people who have Eren Yeager as one of its inhabitants, this is because the whole group that we knew since the first season got together for the final war, with the plan to cause the greatest amount of possible damage to the Marleyan people. From then on, not only does one have a villain, but everyone has destroyed themselves in eternal despair. It is absolutely understandable to look at Reiner and think about his dualities and psychological conflicts, just as it was with Berthold, Annie, Ymir and Marcel. Of course, recovering the power obtained by Grisha and inherited by Eren was not an easy task and having this revelation from the perspective of whom we, otakus, judge as eternal villains, defines what is a real revenge. But ... And when revenge becomes selfish? Or, to be more precise, when it was not selfish? Since Ymir Fritz, ancient people were already afraid of what the power of the 9 Titans could cause. And look now, the destruction, the chaos. Dying children, military groups since the birth of their soldiers, practically suicidal expeditions. Both the Marleyans and the Eldians have had this since the beginning of history and as a result innocent people die, many innocent people. This is what a war is. We always keep reminding ourselves of what a military conflict is so as not to remember a possible arms return. Shingeki no Kyojin is not only meant to please the audience of people who watch anime, it is much more than that. Before I said that Death Note was the anime that was not limited to the measures of what it is like to be a show only for fans of Japanese programs. Now, Shingeki no Kyojin has finally confirmed that it can also be considered a similar anime.

Does selfishness lead to glory? Yes, maybe Eren is right, isn't he? He is a young man who has suffered since the first 24 minutes of the show. But the same determination leads to suffering. Sasha was one of them. I honestly never liked her to the point of loving her appearances. Her memes were hilarious, obviously. ""The Potato Girl"", as it became known, was not just a culmination of Eren's madness, as it demonstrated that it is not necessary to look at the enemy's territory to witness some suffering (even if it pleases its rivals or not). Sometimes, those who are on your side also have greater difficulty in expressing their emotions, in being decipherable. Like Reiner, Eren also suffered. Both are the exact result of political selfishness. They were only separated by enemy territories, but it was not their fault, they did not know the other side. ""Wasn't it easier to just stop the war?"" - Yes of course. AoT was never an anime that put that option aside. But what could they do at that moment? Eren was already more than consumed by the eternal hatred. Whenever he said ""Tatakae"", his convictions returned. It is nothing less than plausible to imagine that his actions are automatically answered.

And what about the rest of the anime? MAPPA's production was excellent. Her difficulties imposed an ignorance by many AoT fans, who do not even know what the work of an animator, a sound director, a promoter is like ... AoT has an enormous amount of fans and seeing her ""killing herself"" is a of the stupidest things I’ve ever seen. Of course, it didn't affect most people's experience of the show, but it does open a wound that will never be healed. Those who are only content with security, just because anime is the favorite, do not know how to admit that changes can be positive. All the characterization of the characters was thought of since chapter 91 of the manga, it is not possible that people forget that this was already decided before they even imagined. Hajime Isayama is an author who is wronged and underestimated by the person who consumes him. It is sad and disgusting to see his effort being paid off just because it is Shingeki no Kyojin. It is not a criticism for everyone who loves the show, I also love it and I have it as one of my favorites, but it is not about me, it is about assuming that regardless of how they did it, MAPPA is to be congratulated for what it broadcast. I doubted it too, but I was convinced with incredible episodes and perfect direction. #THANKYOUMAPPA.",2021-03-28T08:27:00+00:00,9
"Story: 1/10The story in AOT had been pretty mediocre since the beginning. It had begun making sense in Season 3 however with the backstories and all of what had happened in the past looping back in and making sense, but S4 seems just all over the place introducing another country's perspective of sorts which just doesn't seem fitting at this point to do. Not to forget that the world building is as shallow as can be, with the entirety of the world building revolving around only two countries while many a times the characters mention ""the world will see your acts"" or things like thatbringing in confusion as to ""who do they mean by the world?"" because they have never actually shown any world beyond this. 

Art: 1/10
The art in Season 1, 2 and 3 was pretty good, if not the best I have seen in anime in general. The art in this season is like slideshows. They animated Mikasa like a guy and Armin like a girl. They animated the Survey Corps attacking a titan like flies going around on the screen, without any laws of physics on it, it's like a single pic that was moving around as if in an Adobe FlashPlayer animation. They didn't even animate a whole titan because they didn't want to draw 13 frames.

Sound: 2/10
The overall sound of the anime is really bad, when it comes to the character voicelines. Armin was voiced by a female seiyuu clearly, doesn't match with his past voices. Much of the sound design of the anime overall is not good, I have given an additional point however for the ED which I really love.

Character: 1/10
This has been consistent for me since the beginning, nothing has changed to it even now. The characters are still just as bland and lacking character as they were before, they have made changes to Eren but I don't see how that has happened or what has made it happen. Same with the other characters, they show a change having occurred but I don't see where it comes from.

Enjoyment: 1/10
It's still a struggle for me to watch the anime in its totality. I had dropped the first season way early when it was still airing, but now that I have somehow managed to pull myself up and watch the series in its totality, I thought I will leave a review here on the 4th season. When it comes to enjoyment, the fourth season is going very slow and is not enjoyable. There are obvious pacing issues, the animation is pulling it back majorly, and the sound design being so mediocre also pulls it back. The consistent bantering about ""the world"" not aligning with what they have shown us till date also brings the enjoyment down considerably because we just cannot relate to who they mean by the world.

Overall: 1/10
Still as bad as I remember.",2021-01-28T06:28:00+00:00,1
"Attack on Titan is one the best work of fiction that i have read/experienced in the past decade. It might be the best one depending on the manga ending. It is the reason why i am wasting 45min+ of my life writing such a long review. Because it is that sort of work that quite literally made me rethink certain things in life. It deserves it.  Now, i am not going to go too much in-depth as to why i think Isayama is a genius and attack on titan's writing is a masterpiece, i will go straight to the reason why i despise theseason 4 of the anime, adapted by MAPPA.

So why am i giving it one star?

You see, we are in a strange circumstance with the final season of attack on titan. It used to be the case where people hated the use of CGI and hated rushed adaptations with bad animations and bad direction in the anime community. I can still remember when people consistently made fun of naruto vs pain fight a while ago, and criticized the bad animation in Naruto. It was commonplace.

Or WAS it, really? I would argue that this is still the case, even to this day!

Even in 2021, NO ONE LIKES cgi.

Even in 2021, NO ONE LIKES rushed or mediocre adaptations.

Even in 2021, NO ONE LIKES bad direction.

But the thing is, most of these other shows where other people are vocal about these issues, are usually mid if not straight up garbage plot-wise. So as soon as more superficial aspects such as animation and direction fall apart, people are quick to notice and point at it. Making it far easier for the average joe with no attention to detail to feel like what they are watching is complete garbage. So they point towards the nearest culprit, that being the studio.

HOWEVER, Attack on Titan has such an amazing plot and story that many people are willing to completely overlook that, the majority of the time without even realizing it, in a subconscious level. 

The plot OUTSHINES anything MAPPA could possibly spill on the screens.

Before season 4, WIT had consistently provided what must be without doubt one the best animation in the industry with Attack on Titan. Not only that, but they had Tetsurō Araki as the Chief Director for seasons 1-3. THIS GUYS IS A GENIUS. He is the same director behind death note and the potato chip scene. THE POTATO CHIP SCENE!!!!!!

CGI is not the only problem with season 4. It's also the DRASTIC decline in quality of direction compared to previous seasons. In impactful moments such as Declaration of War during episode 5, Armin's transformation, etc, the difference is brutal. I can GUARANTEE YOU that WIT would have delivered us with some otherworldly genius direction, usage of OST and some mind blowing SAKUGA during all these moments. THEY ALWAYS DID. They always EXCELLED at it.

I could argue and exemplify this about any of the many impactful scenes on season 4, but i am going to stick with Armin's transformation to avoid giving any spoilers.

WIT would have probably taken many different shots/angles of the explosion, show buildings and citizens near it being blown up/running away from it. Maybe show a woman on the ground looking at it and being engulfed by the explosion. They would have built up to that moment with the OST. Made the explosion EXTRA impactful by having the camera upclose and using many animation techniques to make the explosion look even more menacing and powerful, and almost make the viewers feel like they got caught in the explosion themselves. Done some crazy animation thingies where armin gets slowly covered by the colossal's fibers and the titan's flesh. His face would have probably shown the colossal titan's face amidst the lightning... God, who knows! My point is, those guys are creative beyond believe. 

What did Mappa do?

Armin takes the hood off, camera immediately turns towards those horrible CGI titan models of the Attack Titan, Cart Titan, Beast titan. Explosion in the background. Then it goes back to a still shot of the Colossal titan with a drowned out OST in the background. THAT'S IT.

Where is the... magic?

Where is the direction we are used to? Where is the creativity? Where is it?
  
Why do you think Bert/Reiner reveal will forever be one of the most memorable moments of attack on Titan. Why?

DIRECTION. OST. ANIMATION.

WIT ARE CREATIVE GENIUSES.

MAPPA turned all impactful moments in season 4 into nothing but a mediocre, panel by panel adaptation from the manga, with some CGI in between. That's just not the quality that many people, me included, were expecting for the most hyped season of the show coming from the manga. THIS IS THE SEASON WHERE ALL DOTS CONNECT. It's where AoT's storytelling truly peaks. 

It deserves MUCH better than that!

What would have MAPPA done in Bert's/Reiner's reveal? Do you really think they would have achieved the same level as WIT? NEVER. Even with all time and budget on the planet.

You can literally see every single fiber of Eren's titan forming as he punches Reiner face and drags his face across the wall. You can feel the impact and power of their titans while they fight. You can see the half human/half titan face mixed during the lightning of the transformation. They never, ever halfassed during those moments. They went far and beyond. The SAKUGA was off the charts.

Again, WIT's direction used every single tool at their disposal to make every single impactful moment from the manga ten times more impactful in the anime. They IMPROVED every single aspect from the manga to the anime. They made AoT with LOVE, they did not treat it like just another project/money bag.

Getting a mediocre adaptation that lacks those very same things in the most memorable of all seasons just sucks. Ngl. It's such an incredible waste of potential. AoT could have been not just the anime of the season, but one of the best shows to air in the last two decades. It's just so undeserving of this masterpiece. 

And what's worse? People are content with it. Because the plot is good, and they associate that to MAPPA doing a ""perfect job"". Or give other excuses such as MAPPA not having enough time to do so, when they agreed with that scheduled and said they could do it themselves. 

So we will sadly, never get a proper adaptation to this season like WIT delivered to us in previous seasons. 

If enough people raised their voices, if enough people showed their discontent, maybe. Maybe the production committee would tell MAPPA to drop it for a while and work on it more before releasing. Maybe MAPPA would do it. But it's too late. What was born with in highest quality will die in mediocrity. 

Now we just got to accept the future and keep moving forward.",2021-01-27T02:10:00+00:00,1
"Shingeki no Kyojin,a title with many hidden meanings, is a series where a mystery box is slowly unveiled as the characters get developed and the viewer gets more interested in the story as a whole. It isn't the kind of story where one can predict what can happen next. Marley? Eldia? Rumbling? I'd consider you crazy if you told me about these during the first 5 episodes of season 3 part 2.It should also be mentioned that it is a story that can make one question their own morality as the characters come into dilemmas, as there's no black and white, just shades of gray,every character is a villain to another character, no matter who they are. This creates questions on who's right and wrong on viewer's minds, and I'm a sucker for such stories.

Now, time to get to rating individually.

Story: 10/10
I feel like crying from joy and get pumped with adrenaline each time i think about the story of Shingeki of Kyojin as a whole. A story that has made me cry, made my heart race, and made my mind blow with all the plot twists and original story writing methods.
Not only that, but the story as a whole changed my whole perspective as a human, to the better. From the edgy shitty little piece of shit I was, admiring to be ooo very cool dark and all, it has transformed me into a being thirsting for truth, thirtsing for discussion regarding freedom,peace history and all. So, for that, from my depths of my heart, I wanna thank the author, Mr.Hajime Isayama.

Art: 10/10.
I really really really like the more realistic approach to the human characteristics of the characters, makes them feel more relatable and also the colours convey the feelings that the viewer should be feeling. People keep complaining about the blur tho, which in my opinion is something that adds more realism and i enjoy it alot.

Sound:10/10
Flawless, part of appleseed played in the end of the episode 4. I expect more reused and news from Hiroyuki sawano, and Kohta yamamoto is really splendid with both aciton themes and chill themes.
I should also praise the opening, ''Boku no Sensou'', it is a visual horror which describes war, as war cannot be described exactly with words, the singer sung ''Ba-ba-ri-as-ras-ti-ti-ti-ras-ti-ba...'', and it's up to us to get the meaning of the song, just like the story.

Character:10/10
Lord praise the realism in these characters-
From Marco to Marlo, the unforgettable total side characters. We felt them as real people, Marco, if he was alive for longer could have become my favourite character of all fiction instead of Armin.
All of the characters interact nicely and realistically, not to mention that everyone has developed from season 1.
Eren overcame his feelings of anger taking over
Mikasa overcame her feelings of love taking over
Armin overcame his feelings of fear taking over
Jean overcame his cockiness
Erwin was explored emotionally more, unlike other tryhard stoic failed commander type characters.
Levi is the seemingly perfect guy but has an endless ammounts of failures and flaws that aren't seen
etc etc.

Enjoyment: 10/10
How can you not enjoy a series where each episode expands it's world and progressess its plot as characters get developed and gets more build up that will lead into a really great episode? Attack on titan isn't the kind of anime to waste it's time on filler episodes. It never ever had an episode which never progressed the story. I never felt bored watching it nor rewatching it and nor will i ever be, for i happen to re-watch 2-3 episodes of specific arcs oftenly just for the enjoyment.

Overall: 10/10
Thank you so much, Mr.Hajime Isayama.
This has inspired me to draw, write, and apply poets into poetry contests at my school, Shingeki no Kyojin holds a very special place into my heart, and I'll probably be re-watching it on a yearly basis, as i'm also looking forward to buying the manga, the games and the blu-rays. Thank you so much once again, Mr.Hajime Isayama",2021-03-28T08:38:00+00:00,10
"*This review is now updated for all 16 episodes*This review contains spoilers for seasons 1-3, so if you haven’t watched it (And idk how you call yourself an anime fan if you haven’t seen Attack On Titan) then please beware. Also, this review is about mainly the Attack On Titan series in general, not just Season 4. Here we are, 7 years in the making and we arrive at the finale of the masterpiece that is Attack On Titan. The true king of modern day shonen will have his last bow as he is instituted in the anime hall of fame with the conclusion ofthe final season. I remember way back in 2014 when I first watched Attack On Titan, the hype was insane so I thought I had to watch it. Unfortunately, 10 episodes in, I wasn’t feeling it. I thought it was another typical run of the mill shonen that was overhyped to oblivion. 3 years later comes Season 2 and the hype returned. I decided to finish it through Season 2, and from that moment on, I was hooked. The writing, the directing, the story, the music, the animation, it’s a beautiful combination to perfectly complement a beautiful anime. If you haven’t watched Attack On Titan (Seriously, who the hell hasn’t watched Attack On Titan yet) then please allow yourself to experience true peak fiction. 


Story: 9.5

I’d say the moment that made this anime a masterpiece was Season 2 Episode 6. From that episode on, the plot in Attack On Titan became so in depth and fascinating that I cannot comprehend having that creative of a mind. The first season fell victim to being pretty cliche and started off as very generic in terms of shonen troupes. The only thing that kept people hooked was the very unique setting and situations they were faced with. And I continued to believe that until Season 2 Episode 6, the great reveal. The revealing of Reiner and Bertoldt being the Armored and Colossal Titan. That was the first of many mind blowing plot twist that happen in this show, and needless to say, I was shook. The ability Hajime Isayama has to hide such major plot points in plain sight truly baffles me. I didn’t think it could get better, then Season 3 arrived. The Uprising Arc really expanded the setting to not just the scouts but also the political structure of the walls and how distrust between the military and the higher ups can cause chaos against humans vs humans. It showed the viewers that the Titans aren’t the only enemies that are in this show and it is fantastically done. Then, Oh lawd, and then we were blessed with Season 3 Part 2. How perfect and utterly flawless those 10 episodes were. Erwin’s Charge, Levi vs Beast Titan, the basement reveal, the explanation of mostly all questions we had while simultaneously creating even more questions. 3 of those 10 episodes have the highest rating out of any anime episode in history, and they're all back to back. I have literally yet to meet a human being who has watched Attack On Titan up to this point and still thinks it’s less than an 8/10. And now we arrive at Season 4. Attack on Titan seems to be a completely new show and takes in the viewpoint of the enemies that reside in Marley. You sometimes question which side you should truly be cheering for and whether you are a Jaegerist or not is up to you. Every side has their own goals and each consider the other as the ""bad guys."" This type of story is extremely fascinating and I'm super excited to see the final conclusion of the season and who will end up lasting till the very end.

Jeez, you can only give a series so much praise. I was enjoying the hell out of this season until the attack on Liberio. I fully understand that MAPPA was only given 8 months to complete this but the intense use of CGI was still very noticeable. For the time they were given, this is a masterpiece. In general though, yikes. I've been waiting for the Declaration Of War scene to be animated for years and when that episode came out, I was just sad. The Jaw and Cart Titan's CGI looks amazing, I could barely notice it most of the time. But the Beast and Attack Titan's CGI looks borderline abysmal in some frames. It was disappointing but hey, that's what you get when you rush a studio. As far as the non fight scenes go, MAPPA knocked it out of the park. Absolutely amazing studio that I hope gets the proper time to adapt the 2nd part of the Final Season.

Sound: 9 

No complaints here, the openings are legendary and the endings to par.

Characters: 8.5

If you pointed a gun at my head and forced me to say something bad about Attack On Titan, I would have to say the supporting characters, specifically the other scouts. I’m not saying they are poorly written, far from it, it’s just that they are more 2 dimensional then other characters. Connie, Sasha, Jean etc. are all decent characters, but that’s my complaint, their just decent. Of course though you have very well written and amazing characters like Eren, Erwin, Levi, Reiner, Kenny, Zeke etc. but you also have some of these more mediocre characters as well. I mean hell, the characters on the Marley side have more depth than the scouts tbh. Other than that, the characters are so god damn good, as a manga reader, Eren is one of my favorite anime characters of all time. Reiner’s struggles, Zeke’s push and pull between himself and Eldia, Erwin’s selfishness to his dream is something that just blows me away. Fantastic writing from a fantastic author.

Enjoyment: 8.5

After initially dropping it after the 10 episodes of Season 1 and rewatching it, I binged the entire thing in less than a week easy. And I could do it again just as easily. It’s literally impossible to get bored or sluggish when it comes to this anime, it’s a full fledged masterpiece. The adaptation for Season 4 made my enjoyment go from a 10 to an 8.5, but MAPPA did a well enough job for it to still be a solid 8.

Overall: 9

If you’ve looked at my anime list or seen my reviews, I don’t like shonen, I think the genre is very overrated. However, Attack On Titan is the diamond in the rough, it was an absolute treat to watch this anime and when it’s finally time for it to come to rest, I will be proud to say: I watched Attack On Titan.",2020-12-27T07:13:00+00:00,9
"If your expectation for Attack on Titan is an anime you can watch on a screen and hear with speakers, then this season will do you well, but if your expectations are a well directed, well organized story brought to life with beautiful animation crafted by a passionate team of talented artists and genius creatives, then you will be sorely disappointed, because unlike previous seasons, this production is so hideously ugly, you’d think Attack on Titan wasn’t the defining masterpiece of our era, which it most certainly is.There seems to be this odd and ignorant consensus pervading the fandom which suggests any and all criticismaimed at a poor product is somehow a direct insult to the workers who made it, and this is a shockingly immature worldview to espouse. Let me get one thing straight: you can say whatever you want about WIT Studio falling victim to Kodansha’s unfair and unreasonable production scheduling in the third season just like MAPPA is now, and how that lead to a double split-cour which ultimately wasn’t even enough to assure consistent quality throughout part two, but you must also admit pointing out these things is nothing more than a diversion from the far greater travesty of animation before you now. Attack on Titan: The Not-So-Final Season is a disgrace to the franchise which came before it on every visual level, and to say so is in no way to deride the overworked animation staff at MAPPA. Am I going to sit here and deny the existence of the throngs of rabid keyboard warriors on social media sending them death threats for producing such appalling CG and embarrassing 2D animation? No, but those people are foolish children with too much time on their hands, and by echoing their indisputably warranted criticisms, I and others like me are not justifying their acts of disrespect and harassment, so I urge you not to feel sorry for saying what you see clearly in front of you and criticizing it for what it is: an ugly, cheap anime. 

After episode six, I officially became a manga reader, since I simply could not let this atrocity be my first experience of Attack on Titan’s brilliant story, and what I found in the manga was absolutely stellar shot composition which I had previously thought was simply a product of Tetsuro Araki’s adaptation. Obviously, Araki’s heart-stopping visual direction and irreplaceable cinematic instinct made the anime adaptation what it ultimately was, but Hajime Isayama’s knack for framing an iconic single image when it mattered most still shouldn’t be overstated when the final season here has neither directorial flow nor memorable cinematics. The new character designs which pride themselves on their close resemblance to the original artwork found in the manga simply cannot use their adherence to the source material as a defense of their janky anatomy and inferiority to the beautiful artwork of Kyoji Asano, and the new music cannot use its passable composition as a defense of its utter incompatibility with Hiroyuki Sawano’s constantly recycled tracks. I understand this is a somewhat particular distinction to be made, but with the sheer amount of blatant animation shortcuts used throughout this season—not even counting the CG—season three part two looks like a studio trying their hardest while grappling with a ridiculous time table, whereas this looks like a studio using a ridiculous time table as an excuse to not try their hardest.

But nevertheless, does the masterful writing save the day and make this thing worth watching? With how much is cut out, rearranged, and left unfinished, I would say no, but that doesn’t make it bad. If anything, the narrative has only gotten better and the themes have only gone deeper. With the basement and its contents finally revealed, the series had to occupy the world it so suddenly established and situate the story as we knew it within that world elegantly, and even with the content from the manga which got butchered in translation, it absolutely achieved this feat. As it demystifies Marleyan society and rationalizes the international bigotry towards the Eldian people, it builds the foundation for one of the most interesting and morally provocative conflicts I've yet to see portrayed in fiction, and it does so with complex characters who never fail to inspire emotion, or inspiration itself. While Attack on Titan: The Not-So-Final season is, indeed, not the final season, it’s still an adaptation of a manga, so it continues the story with more or less the same degree of excellence as the first three seasons did, and while it abruptly ends on a cliffhanger mid-arc, that’s more a testament to the fragile production than the source material, its quality of writing, or the acuteness with which said writing was brought to screen. One thing’s for sure, though, narratives as enthralling as this come once in a generation, and it’s a shame this one is receiving such paltry treatment.

This review was originally going to be a lot more sentimental than it turned out to be. To cope with the extreme dejection I felt after watching such a dishonorable end to this once-great adaptation of an unequivocal masterpiece, I was going to try and write this review to examine the final season as a standalone work while simultaneously offering an all-encompassing retrospective on the modern classic that is Attack on Titan, but after WIT Studio dropped it and MAPPA shit it back out in such a visually repulsive and structurally incomplete fashion, I accepted the fact I couldn’t really do that anymore, and my enthusiasm burnt out along with the quality of the show itself. I’ve lost my motivation to even mind it anymore, and if the fact this season is among the highest rated anime on MAL didn’t make this obvious enough already, you all don’t seem to mind Attack on Titan anymore either. The reality that such a magnificently made work of art could receive such a stark downgrade yet still be well received by the exact same fanbase solely because they enjoy entertaining the mere idea of it is not only a sad reflection of the culture surrounding the work, but a cruel insult to the first three seasons which were only able to be the dazzling spectacles they were thanks to the back-breaking work ethic and tremendous talent of the original staff who so naively thought their admirable labor and impressive results weren’t lost on the audience, who’s appetite all can now clearly see as being apparently, totally mindless.

Thank you for reading.",2021-03-28T08:42:00+00:00,4
"Attack on Titan is a modern masterpiece. It’s not just a piece of fiction which has thrown quality season after season, it’s also one of the very few anime to have broken into the mainstream, so much so that people who do not watch anime at all have experienced and loved it. The emergence of the first season of Attack on Titan drove the series’ popularity to levels rarely seen before in the medium. The long wait before the release of season 2 was a major reason (along with certain pacing issues with the manga at the time) for the dying interest in the seriesat the time. By the time S2 aired, Attack on Titan wasn’t the global phenomenon anymore. One Punch Man had broken the mold in a similar vein to AoT S1 and become the new big anime amongst casuals and non anime watchers.

Then came Season 3, and the series was roaring back. The interest in the series had never been higher, and fans flocked back in droves to have their questions answered. Many began viewing the first two seasons in new light once the revelations showcased the intricate planning and immense foreshadowing that had gone under their noses when they’d watched it first. For me, Attack on Titan was always great. Never has an anime made me feel so hopeless if I viewed the world from the perspective of the characters. The absolute mystery surrounding the titans for most of the first season along with stunning animation for fights, memorable OST for almost any scene and emotional dialogue delivered by passionate voice actors made for an unforgettable experience. Season 2 and 3 bring in more revelations, slowly unfolding the mysteries of the world and the titans and shifting the themes of the series. Season 4 has another tonal shift - much greater than previous ones - and it handles it with aplomb.

A change in studios has often led anime series to ruin. The aforementioned OPM was one of the recent big victims of it, but other popular series like Seven Deadly Sins have also suffered due to it and never recovered.

Fortunately, MAPPA have handled the transition well. They haven’t been perfect (more on that later), but all in all, they’ve done a good job producing a new season of what is probably the most popular anime of the last decade.

The start of S4 might have left some people wondering where the original cast went. There’s not just a change of cast in the first few episodes, but also a switch in perspectives. We’re no longer seeing things from the side of Paradis and the Scouts. Instead, we now see it from the view of Marley’s warriors, who’re training to inherit the titans from their predecessors once their time runs out. Gabi and Falco want to inherit the armor but Reiner, i.e. the plot armored titan (Sorry, had to use this once I saw it on Reddit) can’t catch a break. Someone, grant him his wish to die.

Eren’s growth as a character is one of the highlights of Attack on Titan as a series. He wasn’t always a fan favorite because of his hotheaded nature, but as time went on, his perspective of the things around him changed, most noticeably multiple times throughout season 3. Come season 4, his character undergoes a paradigm shift; calm and sympathetic, yet ruthless. As his famous quote goes, “I won’t stop moving forward until all my enemies are destroyed.” He’s a lot more distant, not just to everyone else in the show but also to the viewers. Unlike previous seasons, his thoughts are a mystery and the season clearly displays the divide between him and the other old Scouts. 

The handling of his growth as a person and a titan shifter is outstanding, firstly in the manga and then in the anime. Yuki Kaji, the voice actor, supported this exponential growth by exceeding expectations on character delivery. I especially love how well he’s transitioned seamlessly along with Eren as a character and nailed almost every line. There’s hardly a line Eren has spoken in season 4 that isn’t extremely significant to the story.

Oh Gabi! Where do I even begin? She’s supposed to be the female parallel to pre timeskip Eren, but apart from some core traits like being stubborn, she isn’t really that similar to him. Gabi hates the Eldians from Paradis for no other reason other than that she thinks they’re devils and should suffer for the crimes of their ancestors. Eren was stubborn, headed into almost unwinnable battles without a second thought. However, his reasons to hate the titans were justified. His mother was eaten in front of him by a titan, his home destroyed and tens upon hundreds of his comrades butchered by titans in cold blood. He fought for his freedom, and humanity’s. 

Gabi, on the other hand, hates Eldians without having seen any of them. She kills people for glory, just for some useless praise. And without spoiling anything, I’ll also add that she’s a hypocrite with her iconic line that’s become prevalent in memes now “But did you see it happen?”.

In her defence, she’s a twelve-year-old girl who’s been brainwashed so it’s hard to not give her some benefit of the doubt. But boy, is she annoying! She’s actually portrayed a lot better at the start of the Marley arc in the anime than in the manga, so I didn’t dislike her as much. She’s neither a bad character nor a great one, but she serves her purpose.

Onto Falco, then. My cute, lovable boy, are you sure you had the same upbringing as Gabi? He’s her polar opposite, able to empathize with his enemies and an antithesis for every one of Gabi’s morals. He views things from a wider angle, often showing maturity way beyond his years. He might not be as naturally gifted as Gabi but he’s a whole lot more likeable. From posting letters for injured people to helping his enemies who shun him instead, this good boy has it all covered. He’s one of the beautiful things in this cruel world.

Pieck is the new waifu that every fan seems to be simping over; Reiner and Zeke share the title of best character amongst the Marleyans for me. Their internal struggles and motives, some of which are only seen by viewers, make a significant contrast to their outer persona, and this holds especially true for Zeke. 

Jean remains the character who makes the viewers question their morals because he questions his own and that’s what I love about him. He’s another one who’s come a long way since the cadet days.

Did you think I’d have forgotten Floch? He might’ve been a forgettable side character who didn’t even have a distinct design before S3 P2 (Isayama has himself admitted as much), but he’s one of the stars of season 4, running the show like the chad that he is. He’s an extremist and his actions are brutal; at times, it seems as if he’s doing it to sate his own ego and hate towards those who’ve imprisoned him and his race behind the walls. But despite all this, he’s one of the most entertaining characters post time skip. He’s unpredictable, spunky and has the audacity to pull off stunts that might’ve had your jaws slacking on the floor more times than one. And who can forget the “shh?” King Floch has unquestionably engraved his name as an Attack on Titan legend. 

There are so many excellent characters in Attack on Titan that the review would be too long if I talked about all of them, so I’ll stop here. 

The character designs in Season 4 see a distinct change, and that’s not all to do with the timeskip or the change in the studio. It’s a mixture of both. To anyone who’s read the earlier chapters of the Attack on Titan manga, it’s no secret that the art at the start was mediocre. Wit Studio did a great job of enhancing the character designs and the art in general, especially in S1.

MAPPA on the other hand have stuck closer to the manga art style for characters (apart from beautifying Armin as compared to the manga, their reasons for which I’d like to know). So there’s a slight change in the art style because they’re following Isayama’s art a lot more closely.

The animation of S4 has been the most talked about point, and for good reason. I’ll mince no words: some of the CGI was downright terrible. There was some genuinely impressive CGI like the Jaw titan, but some very important scenes involving the Attack Titan and Beast Titan were horrendous. It’s not the animators who’re to blame for this but the greed of the production committee and the manga publishers who wanted to have S4 airing before the end of the manga to boost sales.

For almost any other anime, I would’ve let even the terrible CGI scenes slide, but this is Attack on Titan, one of the most popular and highly acclaimed anime ever, and surely it deserved the best treatment possible. Unfortunately, it didn’t get that. Does it make the season bad? Of course not since the season covers one of the best arcs in the manga and the adaptation itself was faithful with top tier voice acting. Could better animation elevate S4 of Attack on Titan to higher levels? Greatly.

My biggest problem with the titan CGI was that it just broke immersion. One moment we had fluid 2D animation, the other we had some janky CGI lacking weight, which made me pause and check if I was still watching Attack on Titan. I’ve re-watched these scenes multiple times and every time, I came to the same conclusion: Attack on Titan deserves better. Remember the marvelous scenes with ODM gear we got in the first three seasons or the titan fights or Levi vs the Beast Titan? Unfortunately, we don’t get that level of animation in season 4, and while understandable given the time constraints, it’s disappointing nevertheless.

The CGI wasn’t always as bad, but had enough prevalence in the most important moments (Eg: Attack Titan vs Warhammer Titan) to be a stain on an otherwise stellar season.
 
We have some new and honestly breathtaking tracks added to the already great OST from S1 - S3. One of the highlights in the sound composition this season is that there were different composers depending on whose perspective a scene is shown from. For Paradis, we have Hiroyuki Sawano back with all our favorites from previous seasons while Kohta Yamomoto handled the Marleyan side, giving us bangers including Ashes on the Fire. I missed the old OST in the first few episodes because I was worried they’d underuse S1-S3 OST, but they did not. It wasn’t used much because the initial episodes take place from the perspective of the Marleyans. Honestly, having different composers for either side of the conflict seems like a superb choice and helps immersion. 

The only real criticism I have about the sound was the OST choice in some scenes in the latter part of the season. And no, I’m not talking about the basement scene here. I thought the basement scene OST choice was great.

Similar to the OST, it took a while for me to warm up to the OP, but looking back now, it’s great and suits the themes of S4. This was a common opinion amongst the community; the majority seemed to have disliked My War for the first couple episodes, then it just grew on people and now it sets the tone for the rest of the episode.

Now that Attack on Titan’s final season (Part 1) has ended, it’ll be intriguing to see what route MAPPA takes for the rest of the adaptation. There’s anywhere between 13-16 episodes of content left to cover, depending on the pacing. Will the production committee see Attack on Titan as a chance to make hundreds of millions of dollars in a movie format or will we have Attack on Titan Final Season Part 2 (lol), only time will tell. I’m not against either, as long as they take enough time and pour passion into making it. I don’t mind waiting longer if it means getting the best production values. Hopefully, that’s the case.",2021-03-28T08:35:00+00:00,10
"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSEvery once in a while, once in a century, once in a millenia, once in an eon, humanity gets a shining star. A star that reshapes humanity for times ahead, a star, that, despite being a mortal human, remains immortal in history. Jesus Christ, Caesar, Da Vinci, Tesla, Einstein, Newton, Aristotle, and many others. All of them died thinking they accomplished barely anything, or nothing at all. It is only years, CENTURIES later, that we begin to understand what they did for humanity. As such, Shingeki no Kyojin can not be appreciated by any of us, since we have many decades, orcenturies yet, to reach Hajime Isayama. What these men did on the fields of technology and etcetera, Isayama did for the culture and arts, forever immortalizing Eren Yeagers true patriotism, revenge AND FREEDOM. There is not a single doubt in my mind that Shingeki no Kyojin will stand the test of time, hanging in Louvre, and be studied in schools for centuries to come. Callling Shingeki no Kyojin an anime or a manga is an insult to it, as Shingeki no Kyojin is an ETERNAL, IMMORTAL PIECE OF ART. I was actually in doubt for a long time if I should even leave a review on “MyAnimeList”, as this is a general purpose “anime/manga” website. SnK is the La Gioconda of the 21st century. In other words, KINO beyond human understanding.

    ART 10

    I had my doubts with the studio change, as WiT wasn't perfect, but was more than enough. However, despite having CGI Titans and some funky rotoscope, Mappa proved they can, and will, provide nothing short of what Isayama intended, which is pure and perfect kinematographique. The scenes flow beautifully, they don't seem to be rushing anything important, minus the Annie scene from the invasion in manga, the colors are beautiful and actually fit with the manga, as WiT was a bit too colorful. Nothing more to say. I gave WiT a 10, and since they had its flaws, it’s only fair Mappa gets a 10 too.

    SOUND 10

    This is self explanatory, we have the same audio team as before, which was perfection. Sawano's name speaks for itself. That's all. Opening is amazing, ending is amazing. Easily the best opening song we got so far. Unfortunately, some casuals like to ruin art by shoehorning lyrics that are not there. The very noise of “My War” represents suffering in audio form, which needs no human lyrics. It is also very likely the OP is going to evolve, as experienced enjoyers can notice some subtle manga hints in the backgrounds of the opening.


    CHARACTERS 11

    Rating this just a 10 is a shame, since characters are what makes this anime great. Young warriors, especially Gabi, lack so much on so many fronts, and definitely bring a weird and unsavory taste in the later parts of manga. You will fairly soon realize that leaving Armin alive was a mistake, and for some reason, everyone except one character loses half of their IQ. So why did I give this section an 11? Because we still have this one man. One man who started as a victim of a senseless war he wanted no part of. Ever since that day, he swore revenge. And in Liberio, humanity got reminded. They lived in fear of the Usurper, and slowly awaited their massacre. Bravo Isayama. We also have Floch, who started out as a literally who, only to end up the best character of the manga, short of Eren. Every scene of his made me get up from my chair, and kneel to his patriotism. Floch-dono, you will NOT be forgotten. They have to keep moving forward, until their enemies are destroyed. Even if they die. Even after they die. Long live Eldia.

    ENJOYMENT 10

    I've been reading the manga since 2009. That's 11 years and 3 months I've spent most of my days studying and appreciating this masterpiece. From the first panel where Eren had a strange dream and posed some strange questions, I understood I was in for a far more wilder ride than I could ever think of. But I honestly can't advise everyone to watch/read it. As I said, this isn't an anime, nor a manga. This is art. And as some people will look at La Gioconda and only see a plain woman, most of the so called ""AoT fans” fall in that category. Unironically, Shingeki no Kyojin takes a very fine taste and high IQ to understand, so if you're an academic, a scholar with a fine taste, hop in and enjoy. It just might awaken something in you.

    OVERALL 10

There's nothing else to mention. All I can say is, praise the patriots, and hang the traitors. LONG LIVE THE GLORIOUS ELDIAN EMPIRE AND DEATH TO ITS ENEMIES.",2020-12-28T05:24:00+00:00,10
"Attack on Titan is probably one of the most overrated animes of all time, and to be honest, I had high expectations about this series. Before I continue, this review will cover the series from the first season to the fourth one, with few minor spoilers.I have to admit that the scenario and the atmosphere are pretty cool, you can feel the decadence of humanity, the empowerment of the soldiers when they want to achieve something, the desperation they have when they fail, and the epicness that the music has is incredible, all along with a great art style; the world is amazing, painstakingly detailed,and it doesn't feel just like a background.

Yes, the aesthetic is great... but everything else was disappointing.

The characters wobbled between a bad and a mediocre level of quality, their characterization is erratic, or they are directly so flat that it hurts, Mikasa, Levi, Sasha Blouse, Erwin Smith, etc, barely have any other personality trait beyond being an emo or an outgoing person, and some of them don't have a proper exploration of their motivations, despite they are relevant characters, we don't have a personal connection with them, ""the Titans killed their loved ones"" ok, but we don't know how good their relationship was, since we just ASSUMED they used to have a good relationship with their loved ones (acording to what they've told us)

Historia is a weird girl for multiple reasons, first, she claimed to be the ""Humanity's biggest enemy"" and then, she becomes the queen of the realm she supposedly hated, and she also decided that her life purpose will be to save everyone. Then we have Eren... Jesus Christ, he is the author's spoiled baby, there were so many moments when Eren should have died, but thanks to the magic of the plot armor, He survived! And don't forget that he's the carrier of a big superpower that makes him so special; you could say that this does not cause anything but a pain to him, but I can't believe that bullshit when the author is constantly saving him so deliberately in such epic ways over and over again.

Factor shock is the main characteristic this anime has, we had deaths of characters who we never met in-depth, or the best we've got from them was a flashback... minutes before they died, such a way to waste the potential of some interesting characters.

The anime stretched the main mystery to the top, either by some Diabolus ex Machina, such as the moment when Annie Leonhart got freeze or the amnesia Eren was carrying. There were so many moments when the great mystery could be solved, but the story decided to delay the big revelation, just to make the plot longer.

The political issues in the plot were... very stupid... I mean, the king was a useless asshole, and no, he wasn't a puppet, he literally was a retard who was sitting on the throne, just to feign he was the authority... and no one in the town had suspicions about him?... ok?

Anyway, I could spend hours and hours speaking on every single flaw this anime has, but my point is clear, this anime is shit 4/10",2020-12-28T10:41:00+00:00,4
"(TLDR Review at the bottom, as always, thanks for reading)最後の進撃が始まる。Attack On Titan. But is it an attack on titans now, or maybe a bigger enemy at hand?I'm sure AOT needs no introduction, it is that one anime that has spammed up everyone's YT recommendations with drip memes, Eren table scene memes, 10 hour fuck Gabi videos and her getting beat up,ｔｈｉｃｃｋａｓａ if you dived that deep into the culture. When the first episode of the final season came out, it was so powerful not even telling my dad for the Crunchyroll to work was possible. When I say this anime is something else in termsof internal and external events, I mean that this anime is something else. God knows when we are getting another community and anime like this ever again. I am glad I was here to experience this bit of the trek with others like myself and beyond.

I could go on and on about the moments shared. But I must write a review for now.


Narrative:
I may sound like a hardcore fanboy, but I am going to explain why I think this is a 10/10 narrative. I would also like to believe that people reading this review are aware of the references I will make to previous seasons. Ok cool. 

Starting off the final season, we get a bit of insight into the enemies on the other side of the sea. From initial impressions, it can be told that this nation, which uses children in warfare, is clearly lost in morale. And that is the slow building of this new true evil enemy of humanity, Marley. How AOT goes around building this empire of Marley is an interesting one. Marley has qualities of a fascist, imperialistic, tyrannical nation that can be converged to past real-life nations in human history. Those qualities don't just exist for the sake of it too, it is part of the long prejudice against Eldians, in which Marley exploits that to grow themselves and their dominance around the world. It is that which starts a whole chain of events. A serious chain. 

AOT FS story is focused on the cycle of hate, the consequences it has and the action people want to take due to it. Everything that has ever happened so far in the story from start to end (as of now) the cycle of hate continues to prevail in high life, all the while both sides suffer from nothing but losses. That is where the story really shines, the story plays two events on both sides of the spectrum, one we already know and love, Eren's side, and the other we are made to hate Gabi's side, it does a good job at making us hate Gabi's side of the story too, but when you look into it, who is wrong in this mindless loop of destruction? Both sides have given birth to a nation that seeks to exploit and dominate in an imperialistic fashion, the other gives birth to a literal bakemono, a Monster, the devil himself if you really want to go there. The story does a really good job of making those find more important questions. No one here's truly wrong because, in war, both sides believe in what they are doing to be the just cause of action. Both sides are deluded by their beliefs so much so that there isn't a spec of question as to if they might be ever so slightly wrong in their actions. Everyone becomes a victim of their surroundings. It is a fantastic way to really emphasize this world of AOT. From the start, it is clear that the hate got too many characters to the point of joining the army at a young age and leaders making up false stories for the sake of maintaining status. The world is cruel, and it sure as hell shows it here.

Characters are really something else in AOT. I want to first get rid of two characters that I found obviously flawed in the anime. Those two being Mikasa and Armin. In simple terms, the former is still a hardcore simp, the latter is still a hardcore weakling. How they don't change after all these years is beyond me. If Eren's drip game can go from 0 to 100, wouldn't it make sense his childhood friends caught on? But in all seriousness, I never quite understood the purpose of Mikasa and Armin. They are annoying, part of the reason I don't like them too much, but I acknowledge that annoying =/= bad character. The bad qualities of them should I say lie in what purpose they serve to the story as of the Final Season in my opinion. Mikasa has some benefit of the doubt given to her, she is starting to open up that Eren's apparent downfall is not one that wishes the best of him in his future, she even goes out of her way to question whether or not he is doing the right thing, but again, for the sake of the story, she needs to brainlessly be there for Eren even when my boy is committing various war crimes in the former Eldian empire. She was going places but easily lost herself due to a static character within her. Her ""development"", if you can even call it that, is a stretch in my opinion. She makes no effort to do anything she wouldn't normally do for a nice change in character, especially during these god awful times that both sides have faced. To be fair, Mikasa is supposed to be this life devoting girl to Eren because he saved her, but no development is absurd on quite a few levels, making her less of a believable character. Armin is still the same dude he was from the start, I honestly don't know why he too hasn't changed, actually, it would make sense that having the successor of human's greatest leader would feel like a burden, but all that time to train apparently meant nothing, well okay then. No development here to be pleased of.

Now, for the real MVPs. Eren. The dude is one of my favourite characters in the series, and not because he does an edgelord moment, but his change from the start to the end whilst still being consistent is quite satisfying and understandable to view. When Eren said he was gonna kill his enemies, he wasn't playing games. He did everything in his power to make that try and this season shows the beginning of such a change of heart.

Gabi. The annoying girl? But is she really? I remember when it was very easy to hate on Eren because of quite a similar personality, I was the same in that boat. Everything she does is justifiable despite being executed in a way to annoy the audience. Past the clouds and she isn't really any different from other characters like Eren. Hate grew on her, and she is fighting for the sake of the people she cares about, sounds a little bit like Eren does it not? Overall, I think Gabi is quite an interesting character, though, unlike Eren, she is portrayed on the wrong side of the story, giving her a different experience than Eren's life, the person she is most similar to. Her character plays out quite well if I am honest, the truth which she faces, later on, the reaction of which makes for a tragic life for Gabi honestly. Great writing overall for her.

Reiner. Gigachad hella swagger Reiner drip glow up. In seriousness, Reiner is one of the best characters in the series. He understands a lot more about the world and the harsh reality he has to face due to the brainwashing and control of Marley, he is a victim of the situation. A tragic one after what he has had to face during so. I feel quite bad for the dude but it goes to show like Gabi, he was part of the corrupted system which devalued his life so much that he was lost of everything.

Zeke is one I want to get a little into too, later on in the story he plays a big role in everything that goes down, but there is more than meets the eye with Zeke. you being to understand his motives a bit more and why he did the things he does, an intriguing monke, to say the least.

AOT uses a lot of explicit themes in the story to give it the acclamation it has, like revenge, hate, dystopia, but one of the more implicit themes to be shared is influence.    I have noticed that every character in AOT as a child has been influenced in some way. Eren with his past trauma growing into hatred, Gabi the same without the trauma, more like a duty. Reiner the same, but it is based on duty rather than anything else, Zeke would get into spoilers, but you will see what I mean when you get there. AOT does well at this and has made for more believable characters in the grand scale of things, past experiences will have a lot on what you say as you grow up. It also makes me think that on both a superficial and intramural level, the story has something to share regardless of how deep you dive into it. There aren't a lot of stories out there like this one. One of a kind honestly.


Audiovisuals:
The visuals are an iffy situation, I would be a liar to say I enjoyed the visuals all the way, but notes to take into account are, watch this at a minimum of 720p HD quality, and try to get used to the CGI early on. The CGI really got to me in particular but I got used to it in the end, it is quite unfortunate that Mappa had been given a really bad schedule, it was borderline impossible to make great sakuga all the way through, welcome to the anime industry where money is a top priority, but that's a story for another time. I understand that there wasn't any substantial time for Mappa to even make 10/10 animation, but it doesn't excuse the fact that this isn't the best thing in the world. It isn't. So I didn't see this as anything of glory for the most part, however, even with a bs schedule, Mappa did actually have quite a bit of moment where there were just great scenes overall, their 2D animation and was still amazing to hold onto the tragic reality Mappa faced. They also have amazing camera work, which made most scenes that much more impactful. I could name a few but they would go into spoilers. This is a tragic category, but it is one that I still found some goodness in. 

I have been meaning to only give 10/10 audio to only Clannad's OST, but that changes today, not that numbers meant much to begin with, but you know. AOT FS doesn't suffer from any kind of lack in the soundtrack to the point where innovation is needed, it also has a wide range of sounds that feature more or less anything that produces a sound, basically, this has it all, the great sound is clearly prominent in this series and has clearly shown that these pieces were composed. So many great tracks to remember, be it due to controversy or just the hype surrounding the said OST brings. OP and ED are in the same boat, I can't say both tracks have left my head at all and on the visuals side of things they are completely memorable and original. Amazing sounds. Nothing less. I also need to talk about the seiyuus because they did an outstanding performance, it is burnt into the memory of how well they performed, generally amazing on everyone's side. You won't see acting like this in a good while I tell you, endorse it now whilst it is still there.


Enjoyment:
There are a lot of things very enjoyable about AOT FS. Most of mine comes from an external experience, in talking to fans about the philosophy of the characters, what might be upcoming and which side are you on. You can do this with yourself internally too, it depends on how you look at it really. Universal enjoyment is really what I just said, mostly about asking yourself the different questions this has to offer, there is no wrong answer which makes it all the more interesting. Random theories come out of nowhere but they could hold water. Is all fair in war? At the end of the day, AOT allows you to build your own enjoyment of what it gives to you. 

Other side factors directly within the anime include hype moments and fight scenes you are just dying for. Whilst they aren't the best, they are still extremely good and something that I find myself looking forward to at times. AOT needs to have its action here and there to satisfy both parties I guess. In saying that, I do have to point out that a lot of people get a bit bored with the slowness of episodes containing no action and serving as plot-based episodes, I would agree slightly, but it is the same slow journey that is worth the while. You just need to prevail. All in all, AOT does a good job of allowing everyone to enjoy themselves. There's something for all in this gem.


Overall - 9.6 (10)
----------

TLDR Review:
Story - 10: Philosophical questions, political troubles, generally very intriguing story to find yourself immersed in.
Visuals - 9: Yes the CGI isn't the best, but it is actually used quite well, 2D animation still amazing and
Audio - 10: Amazing OST, OP,  ED and seiyuus. It is one of a kind here.
Characters -  9.5: Slight hiccup in a few characters, everyone else
Enjoyment - 9.5: Very minor complaint, sometimes episodes are less intriguing than others, but most of the time the hype is still there and this is something to look forward to.

Overall - 9.6 (10)

Before I cut this review off, I really want to put out there this amazing things have gone down with everything in relation to AOT, good or bad, these events were something to witness, getting a following like this again for new manga, which will eventually turn into popular manga, into anime, into popular anime, into a global success, doesn't seem like it will happen anytime soon. I am glad I was here when this season aired, experiencing all the events that went down lol. Truly monumental moment.",2021-03-28T08:38:00+00:00,10
"(SLIGHT SPOILERS FOR SHINGEKI NO KYOJIN AHEAD, WATCH THE OTHER SEASONS BEFORE READING!!!!!!)Attack on Titan has been renowned throughout the years as one of the greatest anime to come out of the 2010's with its massive fanbase and incredible hype, and it's easy to see why. It's gory, it's a shonen with a somewhat unique plot, typical shonen main character and a hot side character and the great animation combined with great sound. However much i hate this series, i always praised it for some great scenes with animation and music that was unmatched by other anime. Season 4 of attack on titan lost thosetwo things that made it somewhat enjoyable to watch.

Story: 5/10
First of all, the battle between marley and the mid east allied forces here makes no sense and isn't explained further but we will let it slide since it doesn't really matter. I don't care how important all of this talking is, but i didn't come here to see these people talking about who will be the sucsessor to whatever titan. It's a snoozefest, and the few action scenes we get to see are really short and boring. In classic AOT fashion, it shows the viewers some extremely long dialogue and utterly boring conversations between chracters that seems somehwat important but really is just there to make us think this story is deep. Absolute trash, the only reason it's getting hype is because of the fangirls losing their minds and soaking their pants because they saw Zeke smoking a cigarette. The incredibly mediocre story of the show has just gotten worse, turning in to some boring trash garbage. 

Art: 2/10
This is the worst part about the anime. The only reason it gets two points is because it is a little more accurate to the manga compared to the previous seasons, but it's still awful. MAPPA obviously don't give a shit about the animation and decided to ruin the one thing attack on titan had going for it with terrible cgi that is hard to look at. Even during scenes with no action, the charatcers seem loose and move like an abnormal titan. The animation quality has dropped lower than my balls did. The armored titan looks like a big piece of meat covered with wood combined with iron mans eyes and the beast titan has a body 10x bigger than it's head, looking idiotic. It's like replacing Godzilla's head with Donkey Kong's left nut. As bad as the titan's look, young Reiner looks a bit less dumb now which is a plus. If it's this bad already, how are they plannng on making the Warhammer Titan look remotely good? The later parts of the series are going to be hard to animate and it seems like this series is doomed. MAPPA are concentrating on Jujutsu Midkaisen it seems. Attack On Titan fans lying to themselves trying to tell themselves that the animation is good is like Playboi Carti fans in denial after Whole Lotta Trash forcing themselves to like it, in denial. 

Sound: 5/10
What the fuck happened to the banger openings this anime had? Guren no Yumiya was a 10/10 opening, Sasageyo was a banger and every other openign was decent too. Now instead we have someone just singing gibberish with visuals that look like a 2020 gender reveal. One thing is for sure, the opneing reflects on how absolutely trash this series is. The overall sound in the other scenes is decent, but not as good anymore. Very dissapointing. 

Character: 3/10
What is there to even say about this. Eren went from a crybaby to a homeless man trying to sound cool with his wise words which just turn out to sound cringe considering this is the kid who was screaming non stop in season 1. Reiner is on the verge of killing himself which is completely his fault. Shouldn't have chosen that path buddy. And now to the new ones, Gabi is a dumb kid who just gets lucky during battle. Falco is probably even dumber; ""I just want to protect you Gabi, that's why i'm ruining your dreams and taking the titan from you so my family can be honorary marleyan and yours can be devil eldians!"". Pieck is possibly the most overrated girl in this series, she looks like a zombie and is almost as ugly as her titan. She hasn't done anything other than trying to look cute. Why is she getting hype? Horny 14 year old fanboys that have never felt the warmth of a woman. Everyone else is the same. Zeke is the best character in the series but so far he hasn't done anything than smoke a cigarette.

Enjoyment: 3/10
This season is so boring i'd rather watch paint dry or even try to read the Dragon Ball manga without getting a stroke. Seriously, all this dialogue is just making me hungry. After the episode is over, I feel like I got nothing from it. Nothing new happened and we move on to re-read a chapter of Berserk aka peak fiction. Trash anime.

Overall: 3 pity points/10",2021-01-03T06:08:00+00:00,3
"Well Guys this is my very first review, I wanted to start reviewing this show as soon as it comes. I'm a loyal SnK anime fan, I somehow managed to keep myself from reading the Damn Manga and avoid (maximum) spoilers. When I heared that WIT Studio is no more animating the series, I was really afraid of a sequel that's gonna end up like Nanatsu no Taizai by studio Deen, But when They announced that the final season will be released by MAPPA I was kinda relieved. Even if they changed the original character design to make it resemble more to Isayama's Artstyle.-The firstepisode which aired last week carried a lot of surprises ; including the new OP and ED where there is no more hyping stuff like SASAGEYO SASAGEYO. Also the CGI titans were not very pleasant to see, that's my personal opinion.
-The second Episode showed us The MAPPA Potential. The color Grading was good, The 2D animations were smooth and stuff... I'm still waiting to hear something from SAWANO since he participated in the composition of OSTs. Also there was one thing that I am sure everyone noticed ; The flashbacks taken directly from previous WIT Studio episodes ... damn I nearly cried when I saw them. To be honest I think that it was the best option to take. They will have more time to animate other scenes where I hope ther would be less CGI and more SAKUGA. The one ARIFUMI IMAI always gave us.
So this is it for the moment after only 2 episodes, I have after all to thank the new studio for giving us a sequel in 2020 as scheduled at the end of season 3 pt 2 regardless of the pandemic and their overwork this year; Jujutsu Kaisen ... GOH ...",2020-12-27T13:51:00+00:00,9
"To think that season one of Attack on Titan aired in 2013, and that I have had the pleasure of following the series since that time is something that makes me feel a great amount of pride. We've witnessed the armored and colossal titan destroy the walls of Paradis in season one, and now the same people that suffered at the hands of Marley are the ones on the offensive. In season three, the world went from 3 walls and a vast nothingness to advanced civilizations and mind-bending revelations. Looking back, it feels as though the aims of the Survery Corps were ultimately meaningless, andthis shift of perspective we were given is extremely thought-provoking.  

Instead of titans being the main enemy, humanity faces war within itself. Showing life from the viewpoint of Marley is refreshing, and I can't help but wonder if we would be rooting for these guys if the series had been about them from the start. Despite this, in the first episode, we see a familiar person in Marley, showing that the Survey Corps has already infiltrated during the time skip between seasons 3 and 4. I know that there are still many truths to be revealed in this season. Will the Eldians end up on top? Who will control the power of each titan in the end? 

I am so excited to see the end of this season, but I am also saddened that this will mark the final release for this series. If you are considering watching this anime, what are you waiting for?! If you don't trust my word, at least trust the ratings of over 70k viewers that have given a combined score of 9.06/10.",2020-12-27T14:30:00+00:00,10
"Oh boy, Attack On Titan is on it’s final stages. This time with a new Studio, and that Studio is MAPPA. Well let’s get straight to the review.Keep in mind that this will be a review from a manga reader(tho I haven’t finished it)Story: It’s Attack On Titan, need i say more? Well, i’ll say more. Attack on Titan’s story is like no other. It can either have you on the edge of your seat, or can make you die of a heart attack due to the amount of shock factor this show has(i mean this in a good way) Attack On Titan’s story notonly is able to play with your feelings while your eyes are glued to the screen, but can also make us think about how cruel humanity really is.

 Now, i don’t know if it was just me, but after the first 4 eps and the rest of the manga. I really started to question,”how this story will get better?” “How it can top itself again?” But each chapter makes the previous ones look like filler. It’s just that good. All in all AoT’s story is a very fleshed out story and well thought out. You can tell Isayama really planned ahead. (10/10)



Characters:

Eren Yeager(20/10)


Music:

Horrible, jkjk

It’s done by the man himself, Hiroyuki Sawano. This guy has turned AoT into a different being on itself. He turned AoT from a King to a fucking God. That’s how good the music is.

 Everytime the music plays, i’m just in awe on how fitting it is. It gives off emotion and perfectly fits the atmosphere of the scene. Reiner and Bertholdt’s reveal would’ve been not as good as it was without that OST. I could go on and on and on on how good the music in AoT is(especially in Episode 3 Season 4) but i don’t got all day, and my thumbs have a limit xd(100/10)


Animation and Art:

Oh, we’re finally here. Now, before you kill me. No, i don’t hate MAPPA, not even close. In-fact, most of my first anime’s are done by MAPPA. But holy shit THE FUCKING BLUR. Now, the blur only bothers me when it’s bright and even then it doesn’t bother me much. But the blur is getting out of hand. I wouldn’t be surprised if we would just be looking at a blurry screen by episode 10.

Ok, i’ve ranted enough. Now i’m gonna talk about the good in their animation.

The character movement. Though the animation in Episode 2 was a little laggy. It was filled with movement. A dialogue episode. With movement. WHAT? That’s a rare case. People who call MAPPA lazy need to stfu. Because damn MOVEMENT IN A FUCKING DIALOGUE EPISODE.


Now we get to the fight scenes(Episode 1)

“oMg cGi horRiblE fiNAl sEasOn rUineD!1!1!1!1”

I hear this everywhere, and i sometimes wonder if they even know what “bad cgi” is. The CGI was amazing(aside from Monke fuck that) They managed to blend it in 90% time, hell I didn’t even know it WAS CGI until the MaL fans were complaining.

I hope we get this consistent quality in the future EPS because it 👏 is 👏 amazing 👏 (9/10)


Enjoyment:

Overall I enjoyed the first 4 EPS and hope i will enjoy it as much in future eps.

"This is one of the masterpiece anime ever made, has the best storyline and the song is very epico.character development can also be said to be very good in its execution. I have no problem with CGI like other people say, in fact, I think it's good. and the character design is also attractive and creates a deep impressionThe opening song is also very suitable in my opinion with the war atmosphere that will occur later in the season finale, where people don't even like the reason that the opening filler is not linked Horzon, but in my opinion it doesn't matterso overall this animeis one of the mastepiece anime ever made",2020-12-29T11:24:00+00:00,10
"[manga reference, no spoils] It took 7 years to get were we are now, we saw those three kids grow up, we saw them fighting for justice for humanity, we saw them losing friends, family, suffering and keeping moving forward with the hope one day they would kill all the titans, we thought they were fighting the enemy of humanity but now, after 7 years everything is fuckedThis anime doesn't look like it will have those types of finals that leaves a feeling on you of enjoyment, this is now a tragedy and I doubt it will have a ""happy"" ending We were watching thisseries hoping that one day we could see Eren kill the last titan on earth, the ending we wanted is now impossible and there's nothing they can do, there isn't a right side anymore, you just watch from all sides and.. feel bad for everything, no matter what side you pick you will just feel bad.

This Anime is a Tragedy and it's everything we hoped wouldn't happen, most animes try to give that sense of satisfaction when you get to the end, this seems to be the exact contrary, you will feel like you watched the story of these people rise just for at the end everything going tumbling down

This opening isn't close to show how sad this last season will possibly be 

Story 10/10

When we started watching this show we never thought it could ever turn into this type of war anime, the author really did a good job of creating this story and the way he guided us throw the years to this point was really good

Art 8.5/10

Could always be better but it's good enough for this type of anime, my problem here is MAPPA, I don't really like their CGI, it's too noticeable and out of place unlike Wit 

Sound 10/10 I don't have to explain 

Characters 10/10 

Unlike previous season this time the characters are very well written, it even looks like the characters were ""shit"" before just to give them this development now 

Enjoyment 1/10 or 10/10 

It does a perfect job of making me feel shit so idk if that's a 1 or a 10

"Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyojin, a name which is very popular among fellow Anime watchers.Originally written by Hajime Isayama, this story never fails to impress us.Story: It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that this is the best story ever written. Everything in the story connects very well. The best thing about this is how it touches every aspect like religion, freedom, slavery, murder, will, and order.Character: Every Character in this story is so good and plays a significant role. It is literally impossible to say who is good and who is bad because of how things differ from everyone's perspective.Art: The Animationquality is awesome, they did great considering that they were tough on time. (Thanks Mappa for taking it.)
Enjoyment: It's awesome but can't say that someone will enjoy considering how tragic the story is. This story is a roller-coaster of sadness and depression.

Appreciation for the Writer.
Hajime Isayama, Writer and Illustrator of AoT Manga is a genius person. The more I get into the story, the more I realized that He thought of everything from the start.",2020-12-27T14:55:00+00:00,10
"Attack on Titan: The Final Season is an ambitious project. Here we have the culmination of years worth of meticulous planning, foreshadowing and build-up. The narrative apex of what started out as a fairly straightforward survival story, now an intricate weaving of political drama, social commentary and grandiose action setpieces, with the best yet to come. To pull off a story of such epic scale on animation is not an easy task. Adaptations of the sort often struggle with several difficulties even getting off the ground, let alone actually doing justice to the source material. AOT has been blessed in this regard by an adaptationthat while not the most technically accomplished or smooth in terms of production, has remained consistently great thanks to its commitment to a strong artistic vision, incredible soundtrack and a genuine attempt at adhering to and properly conveying the events of its source material as well as it can. Not only did it do the manga justice, it often elevated scenes to another level thanks to the sheer strenght of its presentation. Shingeki fans are luckier than most.

Momentum seemed to be in AOT's favor as we entered the most hyped up season of the show since its heyday back in season 1. Many fans were worried about the studio change at first, but also optimistic when it was revealed that MAPPA would be Wit’s replacement. 16 episodes later, I can confidently say that we got another strong adaptation on our hands, but not one without compromises or a fair share of vocal detractors and controversies. With a change of creative leads comes a different vision, so even if this season was produced under ideal circumstances, which it definitively was not, the difference in flair alone would’ve been enough to divide opinions. 

So in order to understand the full breadth of the situation, I will attempt to assess the oft-discussed schism between MAPPA and Wit, how their approaches differ, and then give my own thoughts on this season as a whole. As such, we need to first contextualize the circumstances surrounding the final season.

==THE PRODUCTION==

AOT S1 was an effort of showmanship by then newcomer Wit Studio. Director Tetsuro Araki of Death Note fame, coming fresh off the heels of Highschool of the Dead and Guilty Crown, sought to form a team that would be up to the task of delivering the most bombastic and impressive action show they could make. From the gound up, it was meant to be Wit’s bold proclamation to the anime industry and fans around the world: we’re here and this is what we can do. Numerous as their production issues would end up being, and the staff nearly did almost collapse under the workload, they undeniably delivered a final product that all parties involved could be proud of.

Season 4, on the other hand, is a bit of a different beast on a conceptual and philosophical level. It’s no industry secret that it had to deal with a tumultuous schedule. The team was hastily put together by getting everyone who was available at the time, which is the reason this season was particularly low on star animators and action directors when compared to previous outings. Not by the fault of director Yuuichirou Hayashi either, who’s just as capable at his job as Araki, but simply because the cimrcunstances surrounding the production wouldn’t allow for anything better. Rather than a showcase of the team’s full capabilities or a passion project, this was more about finishing off the job of another studio while trying to please the fans. I don’t mean this as a knock on the team at all, one can only imagine how daunting the pressure must’ve been, but it’s important to point out these distinctions. The fact that the final product turned out as good as it did, warts and all, is nothing short of a testament to the staff's incredible ability of making the best out of an awful situation. Nevertheless, the cracks do show and they only become more apparent the further we get into the final season.

To take over the work of an accomplished team is a difficult proposition in itself, even moreso when said work is already extremely difficult to translate to an animated medium *and* has a history of hellish production cycles. To do so under turbulent circumstances, while needing to start from scratch, was bound to cause controversies. 

Though impressively enough, things started out pretty well for S4. There were the usual complaints about CGI and cut content here and there, but for the most part people seemed excited. That wouldn’t last when we got the first batch of episodes to “not live up” to expectations, resulting in assholes harassing the staff at social media. Sometimes even directors and animators who had nothing to do with the episodes said assholes had a gripe with in the first place. It was an embarassing situation all around.

This eventually led to a state of affairs where fans of the season became perhaps too defensive at any criticism aimed at it while the more vocal detractors used it as an opportunity to lash out at the series in general. Amidst the harassment, the terrible schedule, the hyperbolic negativity masquerading as critique, insane amounts of trolling, and the fans and haters shouting at each other increasingly louder… Well, it became somewhat difficult to discuss this season's shortcomings in a level headed manner.

To make matters worse, well intentioned fans pivoted to singing praises to MAPPA (#thankyoumappa trended on twitter) when they shouldn’t have. Praise the hard working staff, absolutely, they deserve it, but don’t validate MAPPA’s recklessness. Hardheaded as AOT's production committee may be, at the end of the day it was MAPPA who decided to take on such a huge project at the expense of their employees' wellbeing. When literally every other studio was sane enough to decline the absurd schedule imposed by Kodansha, even WIT Studio themselves, it was MAPPA who chose to throw their artists under the bus over prestige. It’s not the first time they’ve commited to more projects than they can reasonably handle either. Sure, they couldn’t have predicted the pandemic, but the schedule was already terrible even when not accounting for that. To defend them is to defend the anime industry's worst practices against its creators. Acknowledge their guilt if you want better for everyone involved.

As a result, this season was a mixed bag in technical terms. A lot of attention has been drawn to the CGI titans which are, quite frankly, the one aspect the show handled the best. Most of them look very good and are well integrated within the anime’s visual style. They move well during action scenes and are animated in a way so as to mimick 2D movement, implementing techniques like frame skipping. Even the weaker ones like the Beast Titan are still considerably better than WIT Studio's attempts at CGI titans during seasons 2 and 3, which always looked jarring and out of place. This is one of the more frustrating aspects about the anime community: no matter how sensible their implementation or how good they look, people will still shit on 3D animation by the simple virtue that it isn’t 2D animation.

What concerns me more is how bad the show can look some of the time. This season just isn’t as aesthetically beautiful as the previous ones, and it does not animate more fluidly to compensate either. There is an overreliance on bloom, chromatic aberration and other postprocessing effects, likely as a crutch to maintain a sense of visual consistency throughout the season. While that works well enough most of the time, it can just as often look like a blurry mess, specially during the latter half of the show. Flashbacks to previous seasons are smeared with effects to mask the shift in art style. Some of the compositing looks ugly. The colors either feel too muted or too overblown depending on the lighting. This is not to say the show can't look beautiful at times, and it does rely on good storyboarding to carry itself, but it never quite reaches the beauty of previous seasons or the full potential hinted at by the pre-release trailer. Some argue that MAPPA handles dialogue better, but aside from some Marley arc episodes the dialogue scenes in the Paradis arc are just as stiff if not more than WIT’s.

Finally, the biggest loss of them all come in the form of the ODM gear sequences. These used to be among the most impressive visual displays of seasons past, full of fluid and dynamic camera shots mixing 2D and 3D animation. These are when the action animation directors really got to flex their muscles in their attempts to one-up each other, constantly pushing the envelope of what they were capable of. All of that is gone. ODM scenes now look extremely stiff and don't even attempt to mimick that same feeling of wild momentum. Even Levi, the show's favorite sasuga poster boy, didn't get a trademark jaw-dropping scene during what is likely to be his last big hurrah. Granted, it was always going to be difficult to follow up on Imai. The man wrote the book on how AOT’s action should look like and inspired his co-workers to follow on his footsteps. To match that while having to start your workflow from zero, without any of the specialists who had been building that skillset over the years, is a herculean task. But given more time I’ve no doubt the current staff could’ve done a much better job than what we got.

I am sure that the consequences of the show's hurried schedule spread much deeper within the season's DNA than just its technical aspects. Less production time means less time for composing new music, rushed creative decisions, important scenes not receiving the priority they deserve, wonky transitions and pacing not getting corrected, and so on. 

As a result, S4 feels consistent but rarely exceptional when it comes to delivering memorable moments. While it sometimes elevates the source material, it just as often struggles to not crumble under its weight. It can be argued that MAPPA’s lows aren’t as low as Wit’s, but they never really come close to matching their highs either.

==A DIFFERENT APPROACH==

So, all right, the season had exceptionally bad production problems. So what? I hear you asking. Just another day for the survey corps. Season 3 Part 2 had a fucked up schedule too and everyone loved it! This is true, though having a team who is already familiar with the material and has years of experience to fall back on makes all the difference. However, not all can be waved away under the umbrella of “production issues”. This is when we start getting into the more subjective aspects of this analysis that not everyone is going to see eye to eye with.

Tetsurou Araki and Yuuchirou Hayashi are fundamentally different directors with their own sets of strengths, so it should be no surprise that their approaches to Attack on Titan are very different. Araki sports a boisterous style through and through, always aiming for bigger, faster and louder. Even in an anime about people writing on goddamn notebooks, he imbues it with such grandiosity and a kinetic energy that you rarely see matched elsewhere. A match made in heaven for Attack on Titan’s larger than life narrative, specially during those first few arcs more reliant on spectacle. It was that energy and confidence that fueled the first three seasons of Attack on Titan and made it such a tour de force that delivered its most iconic moments with gusto. Like his style or not, Araki delivered his scenes with such blaring confidence and pizazz that you couldn’t help but be swept away by his thunderstorm of emotions.

Hayashi, on the other hand, takes a more understated approach to this season. I can’t say I am as familiar with the guy’s work so I have no idea if that’s just his signature or not, but it isn’t a bad match for AOT either. With the time-skip marking a significant shift in tone for the story, a more grounded style of presentation works well for the chapters covered here. Many people have described this season as feeling more like a “war movie”, and I can totally see what they mean by that. There’s this grounded grittyness to how Hayashi conveys the world of AOT.

I can’t claim to be unbiased here. I loved Wit Studio and Araki’s “voice” for Attack on Titan and I was sad to see them go. It’s hard not to grow attached after so many years. Given the choice, I would pick them to animate S4P2 in a heartbeat. A part of me can’t help but wonder how certain scenes would’ve panned out with them in the driver’s seat. Would the low points be lower, but the highs much higher? Or were those highs impossible to achieve given the circumstances? How much can we chalk up to schedule, and how much to deliberate creative choices? One can only guess. 

A lot has already been discussed about the changes and when all is said and done it all boils down to preference. I’m not here to tell you how you should feel about either team, nor am I attempting to offer some faux-objectivist breakdown on who is better. I’ve just laid the facts and shared my views on the matter, you’re free to agree or disagree.

All that said, Hayashi and his staff have every right to be proud of their work here. Henceforth, I will be judging them entirely on their own achievements from now on. Wit Studio can take a bow, they’ve more than earned it. 

Be aware that if you’re reading this review prior to watching the season, the next 2 sections will contain spoilers for the arcs they cover. Skip to Final Thoughts if you wish.

==THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN==

The first few episodes of Attack on Titan: The Final Season do a fantastic job at setting the tone for the remainder of the show. More than any of the previous seasons, this feels like a war drama. While Titans are undoubtedly still the engine driving the main conflict, they take a bit of a backseat to the characters and the world they inhabit.

Reiner’s character study during these first few episodes is perhaps the strongest character arc this season has to offer as he fills the role of the protagonist. His journey from big bro side character on S1, to antagonist in S2 and 3, to a deeply troubled and conflicted individual in S4 makes him one of the show’s stand-out characters to me. May his plot armor live long after the heat death of the universe, carrying all of our guilt and sins into the eternal void of space.

While being significantly more slow paced than we’re used to, these first few episodes do a great job at slowly raising the tension as they progress. We are introduced to a whole new cast, setting and plot developments. The season’s more muted visuals actually work in its favor during this particular section of the story. There’s this foreboding atmosphere permeating every shot, a slow but steep climb of unease that signals something big is about to go off. No other episode encapsulates these feelings better than the first big turning point of the season: Declaration of War.

Much has already been said about Declaration of War than I could possibly do justice during a series review. It is a masterful display on how to build tension and pacing, ultimately culminating in one of the AOT’s most defining moments. While I firmly believe the climax could’ve been done much better for multiple reasons (yes, poor ost choice being one of them, but not the only), it still stands as one of the best episodes the series has to offer. 

Marley’s climax only solidifies its greatness further by following up with The WarHammer Titan and Assault, the latter in particular being one of the series’ best action focused episodes yet, and finally concluding with Assassin’s Bullet, a hell of a gut punch to end this first half of this season. For better or worse, this is also when S4 peaks.

==AND HIS NAME IS...==

Paradis comprises the second half of the season and is when the show starts to feel a little less polished. The animation is rougher, there are more stills and you can definitely feel the production starting to take its toll. Luckily enough, this section of the story is mostly focused on dialogue so these issues don’t negatively impact the show as much as they otherwise would. They do, unfortunately, remain noticeable until the end.

Eren is the other stand-out character this season and the conflicts in this arc are entirely driven by him. Characters discuss and are motivated to act for or against him. Marley and War For Paradis marks a definitive turning point for his character from a reactive protagonist to an active force of change, an unstoppable agent of freedom. He becomes a fascinating character to watch as you never know exactly what he is thinking or what his true intentions are, arguably transitioning to the role of an anti-hero, villain protagonist or straight up antagonist depending on who you ask. His arc, alongside most other elements set-up during these episodes, unfortunately won’t see any pay-off until part 2 airs, so I won’t go into much detail.

The biggest flaw of this arc and what ultimately holds this season back from living up to all it could be is that it ends just as things are about to hit their climax. The finale feels like any other regular episode and is definitely the least fullfilling one we’ve had so far. There is no resolution, just a big cocktease of a “to be continued”. It’s for the better considering the following events could not be done justice under the current schedule, but it still stings.

Incomplete as it is, there are still some stand-out moments to be found here, from Gabi’s continued growth as a character leading to the confrontation at the restaurant, to Eren, Armin and Mikasa’s table scene, to Zeke’s flashback episode. YMMV on whether Levi vs Beast Titan round 2 stands among the greats or not as it is when you can most strongly feel the strains of this production with its jerky movements and unpolished feel due to a lack of in-betweens (and it’s not the only scene who suffers from this). I personally think they did a pretty good job all things considered and I’ll defend the use of K21 till my very last breath.

==FINAL THOUGHTS==

I watched Attack on Titan back when it first aired in 2013. Episode 1 enraptured me in a way few anime premieres have done before or since. Whilst season 1 ultimately lacked in certain areas I thought were crucial for a story to truly carve its place among the greats, it was still a pretty cool action-horror thrill ride with a novel gimmick that left an impression on me. Maybe “too hyped up”, but frankly who gives a shit as long as you have a good time. 

I was excited at the prospect of a season 2 and anxiously waited for its announcement. Somewhere along the 4 years it took, I experienced other stories, found new hobbies and was at a completely different headspace than back when that first season aired. My interest had naturally declined and I believed myself to be over such a “basic” series. Season 2 came and went with some amount of fanfare but nowhere near as much as its predecessor, and so it was easy to ignore.

Fast-forward to 2019 and I see the latest season of AOT carving its way up to MAL’s top 10. It got me curious but I briefly dismissed it as fanboy fervor. All the while, however, I kept hearing whispers. “Attack on Titan is actually really fucking good right now”, they said. “It’s almost like a completely different show now”, they proclaimed. “They revealed what’s in the basement”. All right, fine. I got curious enough to bite. I read the equivalent of season 1 through the manga in order to refresh my memory, laughed at the wonky art, and then jumped straight to season 2. I enjoyed it a bit more than I thought I would. Perhaps I had underestimated AOT after all. Season 3 had a few weak spots but somewhere along the way I found myself invested in those characters I previously didn’t care about. S3P2 exceeded all my expectations. I was a follower of Ymir once again and quickly switched to the manga. And now, a year and change later, here we are.

When it comes down to it, I greatly enjoyed my time with Attack on Titan: The Final Season. It is by no means perfect. Its assortment of flaws are what stops me from giving it a higher score, and I would be lying if I said I’m not at least a bit disappointed at what could’ve been, but by no means does that make what we got bad. I’ve been waiting with bated breath to see some of these chapters adapted and for the most part they delivered. 

Those “certain areas” in which I thought AOT lacked all the way back in season 1 have been fully addressed at this point. This is the strongest the series has ever been in terms of writing and characters and it hasn’t even peaked yet. Even with everything stacked against them, director Yuuchirou Hayashi and his team stood up to the challenge and delivered something that, while lacking those same singular highs of the past, can proudly stand shoulder to shoulder among its peers. We got another quality adaptation when, by all means, this had all the ingredients of an unmitigated disaster.

With the announcement that we’ll be getting part 2 this winter, I remain skeptical about whether this is a healthy schedule to deliver what are going to be by far the most resource intensive, difficult to adapt chapters of the entire show. I really don’t see why the rush to get this out the door when the manga is about to end and the hype is still going. At any case, here’s hoping for the best so we can finish this journey off with a bang.

There is no “greatest anime of all time”. Not AOT, not FMA, not LOGH, not S;G, not HxH, not OP, not any of the animes in the entire top 100. There is no single “greatest anything of all time” across any artistic medium for that matter. For all the bickering, screaming and smug elitist posturing of every fanbase who deems themselves worthier than the other, the truth is the entirety of a medium’s richness cannot be properly distilled into a single work. You can have your favorite(s), but to proclaim it the greatest is haughty at best. There will never be a consensus on that, and it would be boring if it did. Even within individual genres there will be plenty of disagreements. What we do have, nonetheless, is a canon of works of exemplary quality whose legacy endures throughout the years. Those are the stories that stand the test of time, the classics, mainstream or cult. As it is, I can say I wholeheartedly believe AOT belongs to that group of exceptional anime. Regardless of how it ends, it has already delivered a narrative with more pathos than most.",2021-03-28T08:52:00+00:00,9
"Attack On Titan is probaly one of the biggest anime out there besides Death Note or Naruto. And this season will be the end of the anime. Its sad indeed but what do I think of the first four episodes and is it still as good as the other seasons?Or better?-Story-I have read the manga from chapter 93 to 135. The reason i didnt include on my manga list is because I havent read the entire manga yet and that is cheating.The new episodes of season 4 are mostly build-up for the next extreme arcs out there that will probaly blow up the internet. Butlets talk about the episodes one by one...

Episode 1

This was just full out battle and fights left and right, at first its confusing but later everything became a lot more clear. Most people were complaining about the CGI of the Titans, i didnt have that big of a problem exept the beast titan.(at least he looks better then that weird AOT game)

Episode 2

This episode was diaolouge heavy(sorry for bad english) and mostly gave us more depth to the new cast of characters and told also alot more about reiner and how broken he is from the inside, even tough he's called the armoured Titan(ironic). And also people didnt like this episode because of the weird movements(I didnt care)

Episode 3

This episode gave us new information about how Reiner and Bertholt and Annie operated. It was really intresting. Sadly they did cut some scenes but I dont think its that important. This episode was defenitly a lot darker then the others but still verry good....

Episode 4

This episode feels like filler but at the same time, not as much. Side Characters were given a lot more screentime and the entire AOT community is horny because of the scene they added. And the ending was a really amazing ending to end the episode..And now there is HYPE!

Art
No complaints, Mappa did a great job. I would say its better then Wits Style(my opinion)

Sound
Really like the new themes. And ""My War"" is now my 3rd favorite AOT op. But the ending in my opinion is good.

Enjoyment

I could have enjoyed this a lot more if f--king Manga readers didnt say shit, like ccom man seriously let other people enjoy the Story....

Overall

For now I will give it an 8. I liked it alot but my enjoyment was pretty much ruined by Manga readers. Because of them I also read the manga so I could be immume to them. Sadly they will always spoil:(...

Have a nice year, hopefully 2021 will be better",2020-12-29T12:42:00+00:00,8
"Attack on titan season 4 is on its fourth episode so my opinion can change.So far I feel as if the season is following the source material the manga pretty well.It just depends how well Mappa can pull it off since the 3D titans are throwing people off.On the other hand though season 4 accelerates to a whole other level and there's a lot of new characters and good story which introuduces more understanding on titans, the rest of the world, and Erens new goal.Though it starts off with a 4 year time skip in which a lot has changed (in my opinion for thebetter of the story) , but I'd reccomend rewatching some parts of the show.Overall so far I'm giving it an 8.5 and round that to a 9.",2020-12-27T16:13:00+00:00,9
"Do you remember the last time you saw such a big hype with an anime, other than Shingeki no Kyojin? Not??? Well, I ask you to sit down, relax and watch, because I will tell you this little story, this little theater, about how AoT became one of the most renowned and commented animes of all time.Since 2009, when the manga was first published, in the amateur Bessatsu Shounen Magazine, until 2021, there were 12 long years of difficulties in the construction of this beautiful story, which brings together many characters. Hajime Isayama is the main one, obviously. He was so new as a mangaka,that his relevance as a story creator was something sudden, nobody expected that a show in which humanity is constantly challenged and subdued would be really popular, especially with an always constant quality. Wit Studio was also another important character for AoT. It couldn't be any studio, the show should be more careful from the beginning. And that's what happened. In 2013, we have the first anime, a boom in what was known by hype. Seasons 2 and 3 have been completed and the studio has now been changed. It is now in the hands of MAPPA. But did it work?

""Is AoT going to overcome another difficulty? This season is the last one, there is no way not to be euphoric"" ~ Really, these are questions that have always had the essence of this show. Shingeki no Kyojin has never been a great experience without having had very high efforts from your staff.

First, we have the Eldians (or the group focused on Paradis), the ""demons"", for the Marleyans. It is not without reason that the Marleyans adopt this nickname for the people who have Eren Yeager as one of its inhabitants, this is because the whole group that we knew since the first season got together for the final war, with the plan to cause the greatest amount of possible damage to the Marleyan people. From then on, not only does one have a villain, but everyone has destroyed themselves in eternal despair. It is absolutely understandable to look at Reiner and think about his dualities and psychological conflicts, just as it was with Berthold, Annie, Ymir and Marcel. Of course, recovering the power obtained by Grisha and inherited by Eren was not an easy task and having this revelation from the perspective of whom we, otakus, judge as eternal villains, defines what is a real revenge. But ... And when revenge becomes selfish? Or, to be more precise, when it was not selfish? Since Ymir Fritz, ancient people were already afraid of what the power of the 9 Titans could cause. And look now, the destruction, the chaos. Dying children, military groups since the birth of their soldiers, practically suicidal expeditions. Both the Marleyans and the Eldians have had this since the beginning of history and as a result innocent people die, many innocent people. This is what a war is. We always keep reminding ourselves of what a military conflict is so as not to remember a possible arms return. Shingeki no Kyojin is not only meant to please the audience of people who watch anime, it is much more than that. Before I said that Death Note was the anime that was not limited to the measures of what it is like to be a show only for fans of Japanese programs. Now, Shingeki no Kyojin has finally confirmed that it can also be considered a similar anime.

Does selfishness lead to glory? Yes, maybe Eren is right, isn't he? He is a young man who has suffered since the first 24 minutes of the show. But the same determination leads to suffering. Sasha was one of them. I honestly never liked her to the point of loving her appearances. Her memes were hilarious, obviously. ""The Potato Girl"", as it became known, was not just a culmination of Eren's madness, as it demonstrated that it is not necessary to look at the enemy's territory to witness some suffering (even if it pleases its rivals or not). Sometimes, those who are on your side also have greater difficulty in expressing their emotions, in being decipherable. Like Reiner, Eren also suffered. Both are the exact result of political selfishness. They were only separated by enemy territories, but it was not their fault, they did not know the other side. ""Wasn't it easier to just stop the war?"" - Yes of course. AoT was never an anime that put that option aside. But what could they do at that moment? Eren was already more than consumed by the eternal hatred. Whenever he said ""Tatakae"", his convictions returned. It is nothing less than plausible to imagine that his actions are automatically answered.

And what about the rest of the anime? MAPPA's production was excellent. Her difficulties imposed an ignorance by many AoT fans, who do not even know what the work of an animator, a sound director, a promoter is like ... AoT has an enormous amount of fans and seeing her ""killing herself"" is a of the stupidest things I’ve ever seen. Of course, it didn't affect most people's experience of the show, but it does open a wound that will never be healed. Those who are only content with security, just because anime is the favorite, do not know how to admit that changes can be positive. All the characterization of the characters was thought of since chapter 91 of the manga, it is not possible that people forget that this was already decided before they even imagined. Hajime Isayama is an author who is wronged and underestimated by the person who consumes him. It is sad and disgusting to see his effort being paid off just because it is Shingeki no Kyojin. It is not a criticism for everyone who loves the show, I also love it and I have it as one of my favorites, but it is not about me, it is about assuming that regardless of how they did it, MAPPA is to be congratulated for what it broadcast. I doubted it too, but I was convinced with incredible episodes and perfect direction. #THANKYOUMAPPA.",2021-03-28T08:27:00+00:00,9
"Story: 1/10The story in AOT had been pretty mediocre since the beginning. It had begun making sense in Season 3 however with the backstories and all of what had happened in the past looping back in and making sense, but S4 seems just all over the place introducing another country's perspective of sorts which just doesn't seem fitting at this point to do. Not to forget that the world building is as shallow as can be, with the entirety of the world building revolving around only two countries while many a times the characters mention ""the world will see your acts"" or things like thatbringing in confusion as to ""who do they mean by the world?"" because they have never actually shown any world beyond this. 

Art: 1/10
The art in Season 1, 2 and 3 was pretty good, if not the best I have seen in anime in general. The art in this season is like slideshows. They animated Mikasa like a guy and Armin like a girl. They animated the Survey Corps attacking a titan like flies going around on the screen, without any laws of physics on it, it's like a single pic that was moving around as if in an Adobe FlashPlayer animation. They didn't even animate a whole titan because they didn't want to draw 13 frames.

Sound: 2/10
The overall sound of the anime is really bad, when it comes to the character voicelines. Armin was voiced by a female seiyuu clearly, doesn't match with his past voices. Much of the sound design of the anime overall is not good, I have given an additional point however for the ED which I really love.

Character: 1/10
This has been consistent for me since the beginning, nothing has changed to it even now. The characters are still just as bland and lacking character as they were before, they have made changes to Eren but I don't see how that has happened or what has made it happen. Same with the other characters, they show a change having occurred but I don't see where it comes from.

Enjoyment: 1/10
It's still a struggle for me to watch the anime in its totality. I had dropped the first season way early when it was still airing, but now that I have somehow managed to pull myself up and watch the series in its totality, I thought I will leave a review here on the 4th season. When it comes to enjoyment, the fourth season is going very slow and is not enjoyable. There are obvious pacing issues, the animation is pulling it back majorly, and the sound design being so mediocre also pulls it back. The consistent bantering about ""the world"" not aligning with what they have shown us till date also brings the enjoyment down considerably because we just cannot relate to who they mean by the world.

Overall: 1/10
Still as bad as I remember.",2021-01-28T06:28:00+00:00,1
"Attack on Titan is one the best work of fiction that i have read/experienced in the past decade. It might be the best one depending on the manga ending. It is the reason why i am wasting 45min+ of my life writing such a long review. Because it is that sort of work that quite literally made me rethink certain things in life. It deserves it.  Now, i am not going to go too much in-depth as to why i think Isayama is a genius and attack on titan's writing is a masterpiece, i will go straight to the reason why i despise theseason 4 of the anime, adapted by MAPPA.

So why am i giving it one star?

You see, we are in a strange circumstance with the final season of attack on titan. It used to be the case where people hated the use of CGI and hated rushed adaptations with bad animations and bad direction in the anime community. I can still remember when people consistently made fun of naruto vs pain fight a while ago, and criticized the bad animation in Naruto. It was commonplace.

Or WAS it, really? I would argue that this is still the case, even to this day!

Even in 2021, NO ONE LIKES cgi.

Even in 2021, NO ONE LIKES rushed or mediocre adaptations.

Even in 2021, NO ONE LIKES bad direction.

But the thing is, most of these other shows where other people are vocal about these issues, are usually mid if not straight up garbage plot-wise. So as soon as more superficial aspects such as animation and direction fall apart, people are quick to notice and point at it. Making it far easier for the average joe with no attention to detail to feel like what they are watching is complete garbage. So they point towards the nearest culprit, that being the studio.

HOWEVER, Attack on Titan has such an amazing plot and story that many people are willing to completely overlook that, the majority of the time without even realizing it, in a subconscious level. 

The plot OUTSHINES anything MAPPA could possibly spill on the screens.

Before season 4, WIT had consistently provided what must be without doubt one the best animation in the industry with Attack on Titan. Not only that, but they had Tetsurō Araki as the Chief Director for seasons 1-3. THIS GUYS IS A GENIUS. He is the same director behind death note and the potato chip scene. THE POTATO CHIP SCENE!!!!!!

CGI is not the only problem with season 4. It's also the DRASTIC decline in quality of direction compared to previous seasons. In impactful moments such as Declaration of War during episode 5, Armin's transformation, etc, the difference is brutal. I can GUARANTEE YOU that WIT would have delivered us with some otherworldly genius direction, usage of OST and some mind blowing SAKUGA during all these moments. THEY ALWAYS DID. They always EXCELLED at it.

I could argue and exemplify this about any of the many impactful scenes on season 4, but i am going to stick with Armin's transformation to avoid giving any spoilers.

WIT would have probably taken many different shots/angles of the explosion, show buildings and citizens near it being blown up/running away from it. Maybe show a woman on the ground looking at it and being engulfed by the explosion. They would have built up to that moment with the OST. Made the explosion EXTRA impactful by having the camera upclose and using many animation techniques to make the explosion look even more menacing and powerful, and almost make the viewers feel like they got caught in the explosion themselves. Done some crazy animation thingies where armin gets slowly covered by the colossal's fibers and the titan's flesh. His face would have probably shown the colossal titan's face amidst the lightning... God, who knows! My point is, those guys are creative beyond believe. 

What did Mappa do?

Armin takes the hood off, camera immediately turns towards those horrible CGI titan models of the Attack Titan, Cart Titan, Beast titan. Explosion in the background. Then it goes back to a still shot of the Colossal titan with a drowned out OST in the background. THAT'S IT.

Where is the... magic?

Where is the direction we are used to? Where is the creativity? Where is it?
  
Why do you think Bert/Reiner reveal will forever be one of the most memorable moments of attack on Titan. Why?

DIRECTION. OST. ANIMATION.

WIT ARE CREATIVE GENIUSES.

MAPPA turned all impactful moments in season 4 into nothing but a mediocre, panel by panel adaptation from the manga, with some CGI in between. That's just not the quality that many people, me included, were expecting for the most hyped season of the show coming from the manga. THIS IS THE SEASON WHERE ALL DOTS CONNECT. It's where AoT's storytelling truly peaks. 

It deserves MUCH better than that!

What would have MAPPA done in Bert's/Reiner's reveal? Do you really think they would have achieved the same level as WIT? NEVER. Even with all time and budget on the planet.

You can literally see every single fiber of Eren's titan forming as he punches Reiner face and drags his face across the wall. You can feel the impact and power of their titans while they fight. You can see the half human/half titan face mixed during the lightning of the transformation. They never, ever halfassed during those moments. They went far and beyond. The SAKUGA was off the charts.

Again, WIT's direction used every single tool at their disposal to make every single impactful moment from the manga ten times more impactful in the anime. They IMPROVED every single aspect from the manga to the anime. They made AoT with LOVE, they did not treat it like just another project/money bag.

Getting a mediocre adaptation that lacks those very same things in the most memorable of all seasons just sucks. Ngl. It's such an incredible waste of potential. AoT could have been not just the anime of the season, but one of the best shows to air in the last two decades. It's just so undeserving of this masterpiece. 

And what's worse? People are content with it. Because the plot is good, and they associate that to MAPPA doing a ""perfect job"". Or give other excuses such as MAPPA not having enough time to do so, when they agreed with that scheduled and said they could do it themselves. 

So we will sadly, never get a proper adaptation to this season like WIT delivered to us in previous seasons. 

If enough people raised their voices, if enough people showed their discontent, maybe. Maybe the production committee would tell MAPPA to drop it for a while and work on it more before releasing. Maybe MAPPA would do it. But it's too late. What was born with in highest quality will die in mediocrity. 

Now we just got to accept the future and keep moving forward.",2021-01-27T02:10:00+00:00,1
"Shingeki no Kyojin,a title with many hidden meanings, is a series where a mystery box is slowly unveiled as the characters get developed and the viewer gets more interested in the story as a whole. It isn't the kind of story where one can predict what can happen next. Marley? Eldia? Rumbling? I'd consider you crazy if you told me about these during the first 5 episodes of season 3 part 2.It should also be mentioned that it is a story that can make one question their own morality as the characters come into dilemmas, as there's no black and white, just shades of gray,every character is a villain to another character, no matter who they are. This creates questions on who's right and wrong on viewer's minds, and I'm a sucker for such stories.

Now, time to get to rating individually.

Story: 10/10
I feel like crying from joy and get pumped with adrenaline each time i think about the story of Shingeki of Kyojin as a whole. A story that has made me cry, made my heart race, and made my mind blow with all the plot twists and original story writing methods.
Not only that, but the story as a whole changed my whole perspective as a human, to the better. From the edgy shitty little piece of shit I was, admiring to be ooo very cool dark and all, it has transformed me into a being thirsting for truth, thirtsing for discussion regarding freedom,peace history and all. So, for that, from my depths of my heart, I wanna thank the author, Mr.Hajime Isayama.

Art: 10/10.
I really really really like the more realistic approach to the human characteristics of the characters, makes them feel more relatable and also the colours convey the feelings that the viewer should be feeling. People keep complaining about the blur tho, which in my opinion is something that adds more realism and i enjoy it alot.

Sound:10/10
Flawless, part of appleseed played in the end of the episode 4. I expect more reused and news from Hiroyuki sawano, and Kohta yamamoto is really splendid with both aciton themes and chill themes.
I should also praise the opening, ''Boku no Sensou'', it is a visual horror which describes war, as war cannot be described exactly with words, the singer sung ''Ba-ba-ri-as-ras-ti-ti-ti-ras-ti-ba...'', and it's up to us to get the meaning of the song, just like the story.

Character:10/10
Lord praise the realism in these characters-
From Marco to Marlo, the unforgettable total side characters. We felt them as real people, Marco, if he was alive for longer could have become my favourite character of all fiction instead of Armin.
All of the characters interact nicely and realistically, not to mention that everyone has developed from season 1.
Eren overcame his feelings of anger taking over
Mikasa overcame her feelings of love taking over
Armin overcame his feelings of fear taking over
Jean overcame his cockiness
Erwin was explored emotionally more, unlike other tryhard stoic failed commander type characters.
Levi is the seemingly perfect guy but has an endless ammounts of failures and flaws that aren't seen
etc etc.

Enjoyment: 10/10
How can you not enjoy a series where each episode expands it's world and progressess its plot as characters get developed and gets more build up that will lead into a really great episode? Attack on titan isn't the kind of anime to waste it's time on filler episodes. It never ever had an episode which never progressed the story. I never felt bored watching it nor rewatching it and nor will i ever be, for i happen to re-watch 2-3 episodes of specific arcs oftenly just for the enjoyment.

Overall: 10/10
Thank you so much, Mr.Hajime Isayama.
This has inspired me to draw, write, and apply poets into poetry contests at my school, Shingeki no Kyojin holds a very special place into my heart, and I'll probably be re-watching it on a yearly basis, as i'm also looking forward to buying the manga, the games and the blu-rays. Thank you so much once again, Mr.Hajime Isayama",2021-03-28T08:38:00+00:00,10
"(Contains spoilers for every season)Where do I even begin? AOT is one of those animes that people can't hate because there are literally no flaws in this phenomenal series. Everything that a shounen anime can do is in this series-- amazing action, amazing MC, memorable characters, YOU NAME IT! I usually respect other people's negative opinion on other animes but i just can't seem to understand why people say this is overrated or bad? (Maybe they just hate it because it defeated FMAB?)  Before I start off my review, I just wanna say thank you Isayama (the author) for making such a masterpiece.The depthof writing that Isayama (the author) did with this series is actually insane and it actually blows my mind to think that this is his FIRST ever manga that he has published. Now with that out of the way, let's see what I wrote about AOT S4.

(I have extremely bad grammar so if you don't want that then don't read this review)

Story: 10/10
Do I really need to explain? After season 3, the story took a big hard right turn. This was a pretty risky turn, considering the fact that the story was already doing so well. I'm so glad that the change of story was impressively well done, it still had the same intriguing and fun vibe to it. Knowing that humanity exist outside the walls, it gave us more theories and thoughts about what the world of AOT actually is and that's what made the story so good in this season. The thrilling aura of knowing that there are so much more to explore in the world of AOT makes the overall story so fascinating.

Art/Animation: 9/10 
Now this is where I get kinda controversial.... MAPPA did an insanely good job with AOT and I personally prefer MAPPA over Production I.G but that doesn't mean the animation is perfect. I gave this a 9 because there are some minor flaws with the animation and art but it's actually pretty easy to ignore those flaws so I don't think you need to worry about the fight scenes and stuff. To summarize, the animation is godly

Character/s: 10/10
I absolutely love the characters in this season. Gabi and Falco are such a great addition to the series. Seeing characters developments like with Jean, Eren, Armin and more makes all the characters so intriguing and I absolutely love the fact that they basically made Reiner the MC of this season. What else can I say, man? All of the characters are so fun to watch and very memorable too.

Enjoyment: 10/10
I had a lot of fun watching this season. The first 3 episodes might not entertain you but as a manga reader, I personally enjoyed every episode like it was my last day on earth. I don't know what else to say at this point tbh. 

Overall: 10/10
Attack on Titan is a masterpiece. I am so hyped for the next part/season and I would obviously recommend this series to anyone who are looking for anime recommendations. 

Now for some questions that y'all might ask:

Is this the best anime of all time?
Perhaps

Will some people find this series not good?
Probably not, some people just hate it this series because of it's popularity

Should I watch it?
Definitely



That's all for my review on AOT! If you disagree with me then you're free to do so. I apologize if you didn't understand a single sentence in my review 🗿",2021-03-28T09:08:00+00:00,10
"Alright I'll be talking about the final season, the manga and will also be acknowledging other anime like FMAB.First, let me talk about this season. The episodes were insane with the soundtrack, animation and the only drawback was the CG, which was pretty good too. So I'd give it a 9.5/10.Now let me address the manga and the hype around it. I've read every single chapter and it is honestly an incredibly well written piece of fiction with every single piece of the puzzle connecting. The characters are top tier and a few have had amazing development over the years. This season's change in perspectiveand showing that not everything is black or white and is just a spectrum is exceptional. A lot of anime just show the villain being a bad character and might show why they are doing so but not much. Whereas in AOT, you start to question whether the ""bad"" character is ""bad"" at all. 

After S3, I thought how could anyone push beyond this and boy did Isayama show me how. The story of S4 is phenomenal and it just gets better from here. S4P1 isn't even the pieck of AOT. So believe in the hype and just see how this goes, even if you don't like it now.

Now, let me address other anime like FMAB. After finishing AOT(my 4th or 5th anime), it became my favorite and a lot of anime could have dethroned it from the #1 spot and I was waiting to see such an anime. I watched Code Geass and it was so good that it came close to being my favorite but I had to put it at #2 because of a few flaws. Then I saw the #1 anime on every anime list, FMAB and it being my 30th-ish anime, I had my expectations low because of all the trashy anime I had seen before it and it had a huge shot at being my favorite. After watching it, I saw why people call it a masterpiece and it was an incredible anime BUT it still wasn't good enough to beat AOT. It had a few flaws here and there, which is not that much because the overall story was phenomenal. But when I compare it to AOT, which I believe to be flawless (or at least having the least amount of flaws I have seen), it couldn't dethrone it.

In my eyes, all 3 are masterpieces but AOT has proven itself to be #1 by having 3 of its episodes in the top 10 of IMDb and the only anime series in the top 10.

So that was all I wanted to address in the review and again, this season is going to be amazing and I hope people can see why it deserves the top spot.

Can't wait for part 2!!!

(Btw this is coming from someone who once was not going to see the show, let alone make it his favorite)",2021-03-28T08:47:00+00:00,10
"Attack on Titan. WOW **Some minor spoilers If you have not watched Season 1-3Im sat here listening to the OSTs writing this and the goosebumps this show gives me is unreal. This is the only show I can re-watch time and time again and my satisfaction will always be immeasurableThis Final Season Has everyone gassed because they are now past the walls and Erens ideals have now changed. Rather than trying to destroy all the dumb titans he has realised that they are his people and the real enemies are the ones that do not accept him and everyone at Paradis because of their ancestry.Sofar so good everything seems to be in line with the manga but i hope they are able to fit the remaining 40+ chapters in 16 episodes and not fumble the ending like tokyo ghoul.

Story: Very unique story so far and its swayed from what it was in the first season. Very different from the big shounens like Naruto, Bleach, .etc and I think thats what sets it apart

Art:Wit studios were amazing from the first 3 seasons. I liked the way the lines drawn looked defined and their 2D animations were superb however their CGI with characters like King Reiss and the Colossal TItan were below par. That is were MAPPA comes in. When I first learnt it was MAPPA i was so hapoy because they also did Jujutsu Kaisen. Some episodes that MAPPA have done so far have looked a bit weird but we'll just have to wait till we see the fighting scenes.

Sound: A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!!, They always seem to have the perfect OSTs for each event and you can always feel the emotion and rage in the character. All the Openings are amazing. This new one is my favourite

Character:All the Characters are very well written. Especially Erwin and Eren. The way each person changes and grows from Season 1-3 is quite good. But i feel like some of the side-main characters like Connie and Sasha do not really do much. they are decent though

Enjoyment: I was always fully engaged and I really enjoyed it because I was always trying to pick up little pieces of information to create possible theories.
Very Enjoyable and Action packed. The Gore can be a turn off for some but I love it


Overall. Amazing show. Goated. I have watched all if not most mainstream animes and everything about this show is just so great. Its very hard to find its flaws. The only ones to write bad reviews or say bad stuff about this anime is the FMAB fans because by june 9th Attack on  Titan will be No.1 on this list",2021-01-06T17:55:00+00:00,10
"The rest of the season done very well and of course my expectation to this one is much higher than those because this will be the final. So far the story and how the studio animate it is very crucial specially for those scenes where in it is very important to the storyline like hints or something but some of them is very obvious. It might be slow-pacing to others but technically that is how will you understand the flow of it. Art is great though, they really come up with the latest one and let's hope that this will continue until the very end(I'll edit this if something awful will happen). YES for me it is enjoyable I don't know why some pips don't like it to be a slow-pace but for me it is like the others because they are not a long type of series. Overall it is great(so far) and will hope that the rest of the material will be a bomb to us!",2021-01-12T01:16:00+00:00,10
"The fourth season of Titan already surpassed the staffs wildest strech goal before it was even finished. It already considered to be on the same level of Naoki Urasawa's Monster in term of portraying psychological depths of it's characters; an instant cult classic.I will pay $1000 to Myanimelist if the entirety of the season doesn't turn out that way. This franchise wasn't even included in my top 10 personal favourite, yet it's raw presentation  alone has an objective quality that I can't deny. This season is PURE FANSERVICE for the fans of psycological storyteling.Attack on Titan 4 achieved what Game of Thrones 8 wantsto be but fails.",2021-01-11T11:25:00+00:00,10
"Art: 9The visual animation by Wit Studio is a work of praise. I could find any other studio to work on this anime. The animation is stunning and it did a great job to make the titan scary and horror once again.As soon as I heard that MAPPA was gonna take over I was kinda worried what they would make of this series but I guess those worries faded away as soon as i got to see a few episodes.Character: 10This is the most important aspect of any anime, and Attack On Titan has produced some impressive characters: Erwin, Levi, and my favourite “Sasha,” justto name a few. And this season isn’t going to be any different, more characters will be introduced than ever before and the ongoing events are going to lead to some drastic character developments. We’ll keep seeing interesting dilemmas, PTSDs, the rationality as well as the irrationality of those smothered with hatred, and how there is no right or wrong in Attack on titan. It’s all one big Morality-fest. And did I mention “Racism”? These first four episodes made it pretty clear just how strong racism is in this anime, it’s basically the plot, so it’s not going away anytime soon, unless…

Sound: 10

This is self explanatory, we have the same audio team as before, which was perfection. Sawano's name speaks for itself. That's all. Opening is amazing, ending is amazing. Easily the best opening song we got so far. Unfortunately, some casuals like to ruin art by shoehorning lyrics that are not there. The very noise of “My War” represents suffering in audio form, which needs no human lyrics. It is also very likely the OP is going to evolve, as experienced enjoyers can notice some subtle manga hints in the backgrounds of the opening.

"So here we have it, the last season of attack on titan, the series that a few people have hated and many loved throughout the years. Although I would say that from the pace at which it is moving in this season which is 1.5/2 chapters per episode, this may not be the ""final"" final season but actually final season part 1 because I suspect that it may adapt upto chapter 122 which also was the last scene showcased in the trailer. I never thought that this series would evolve so much, from a straightforward shounen story about killing titans to deep politics and excitinghistory and revelations after season 3, I was hyped up for this season like MAAAAAD. I caught up to the manga and now I can say that many people won't consider this as the greatest anime of all time but for me personally, it already has started showing the sign that the ending will be as good as I have been imagining it to be.

Story-8 :
Now now, I won't be like those fans and be like, ""OH MA GAWD, THE STORY SHO DEEP SO PHILOSOPHICAL OOOOOH. EREN THIS EREN THAT, LEVI SO HOOOTTT OMGGGGGGGG."" no, fuck no. Thats just straight up awful. The reason why I like it so much is that when I first watched the series which was around the time when s2 started airing, I was like hmm....This was a pretty OK series and I ddnt know whether I should start watching s2 or just dump it there. I decided to dump it and move on. Fast-forward 2 years later. I was just randomly chilling on Youtube and saw gigguk's video titled, ""Attack on titan is incredible now"". I got curious and started watching season 2 and ended up completing the whole thing in 2 days. And what I saw within those two days left my jaw hanging. The way that this series went from a generic shounen to a full political, horror/thriller was something I had never seen in a ""shounen"" anime before. Mind you I said ""shounen"". And as of now 4 episodes of season 4 have been released and the way MAPPA is adapting the plot is almost perfect although I would say that I did find some hiccups here and there so if they plan on fixing it later, I will update my review when this is done airing.

Art-8:
I would say that Isayama has improved a LOT in the past few years regarding his art. I remember reading the manga back in 2018 and seeing that the drawings were so janky that it was impossible to read and now, the manga panels look very good, almost perfect for the story. And the way MAPPA adapted those panels really makes me feel like I am actually watching Isayama's work animated. I prefer this over WIT although their work was pretty good too.

Character-10:
What can I even say about the characters of AOT that hasnt already been said? Probably the most human characters for me in any shounen out there. For the complaints of characters not having any emotions and depths, Eren's mother and Eren was explained very clearly in the memories of grisha jaegar in S3 and small details were given in the first episode too. Marco's death and how he died showed us the characters of the trio annie, bert and reiner and why they behave like that. All the characters had their back-stories told and if you didn't care for them despite that, it doesn't mean that they suck as characters, its just that you were looking for something else in them and what you found was not according to how you were expecting things to go. And for people hating on jean's character saying its useless, just watch this season and then say that.

Enjoyment/Overall-10:
Now, I usually rate my series according to how I liked/enjoyed it and not the method of rating art goes through stuffs like pacing, consistency blah blah. AOT was one of the rare shows that improved as the seasons went on and that alone was enough to make me convinced that isayama will now disappoint me with the ending. I might edit this review in future because you never know what will happen but till now, its my favorite series out of all I have watched and I hope that it will be forever.",2021-01-06T13:50:00+00:00,10
"Surprise, this is a normal review and not some dumbass unnecessary hate!This new season had to be created within a short period of time and Mappa have done a great job doing so. I have seen people overreact and act as though an abomination has been created and that it is Berserk 2016 all over again. The CGI scenes are smooth and even though the art is not detailed like it was in Studio Wit, it is still good and actually follows the manga style with normal body proportions. The new character designs look awesome, and no, Mikasa does not look like a man, ifyou want to watch a crappy anime with your crappy waifus, go watch Akame ga Kill or something. 

Attack on Titan is one of the most popular anime’s out there and the story has developed from a simple shounen show to a far more deeper story that makes you question who the real enemy is (as quoted by Erwin)
The character development and extreme change of Eren Yeager has been demonstrated perfectly so far and I’m excited to see how other characters change and develop.

The sound is fine, the opening is not as iconic as Guren no Yumiya but it is ok. The ending song for this season is perfect though. Overall, the ost is great. 
Enjoyment is a 10/10, the recent episodes have me at the edge of my seat.",2021-01-18T14:24:00+00:00,10
"If you are not watching this YOU NEED TO!it may just be the best final season of any anime/show/series to ever be made.At first, I was unsure why they swapped studios to MAPPA maybe money or timing problems, but I'm sure we can thank the director for this wise choice.In this darker world, the post-time-skip characters the whole feel of the show has changed. Our heroes are no longer children fighting against the unknown enemy. They may just be the unknown enemy and about to bring the world to its knees.The only qualms you can have is the different music, art or characters newly introduced.Butif you go into this not expecting the old Shingeki no Kyojin, but the new MAPPA Attack on Titan, you will be beyond pleased!

This is the perfect shade of dark/apocalypse to contrast WIT studio's terror/fear.",2021-01-17T17:05:00+00:00,10
"The story just continues to be brilliant, especially for viewers who haven't read the manga. There are new characters emerging with good development and seeing the old characters as adults is really nice. However, it is a pity that you don't really experience the development of the old characters, instead new characters  are introduced right at the beginning.Sound-wise the anime is still very immersive and the music really enjoyable.BUT: The CGI animations are horrible. All the Titans and even the scouts were animated with CGI. As a result, the animations run at what feels like 10 fps. Some claim that the CGI is barelynoticeable. Even my grandmother with her poor eyesight noticed the difference right away, and pointed it out when we watched it together.

The last season was unfortunately ruined by the bad animations. Very unfortunate.",2021-01-18T17:18:00+00:00,2
"Attack on Titan has various things because of which it's deemed as a masterpiece by many. One of those things is the heavy realism. What looks like a horror fantasy quickly changes its tone and becomes a realistic, modern, pre war setting, psychological drama anime. The duality of freedom and the causes and consequences of long borne hatred are perfectly depicted.The way the characters interact with others, react to situations, all of it is done extremely well. Fighting for freedom, oppression of a race, politics, war, ask for anything and AoT provides it to you.One of the most important things is the narration and storytelling. The amount of foreshadowing and how every piece of mystery connects them together at the end, just makes one wanna wonder about the depth of the plot.

Growth of characters, Eren grew up from being a naive and revenge thirsty person to someone who understands the world more than anyone.

Upto E5 the adaptation has been faithful with very less skips from the source. I would like to write much more but that'd be spoiling for anime onlies.

With that being said now I can claim AoT Final Season to be 10/10 masterpiece.",2021-01-10T09:47:00+00:00,10
"I'm just going to say it: This season sucked.I'm not some AoT hater, while the series has had its bumps, I've given every previous season a positive score. I like this series, but the hype for this extremely flawed season is absolutely ridiculous.Let's start with the most pervasive problem; this show just isn't fun to watch. The dialog is awkward, the characters shout all the time when it's just not necessary at all, and they beat you over your head with their themes so hard it genuinely made it hard for me to even keep watching at times. Plus there are moments the art showsa character making a reaction face that's just...ugly. Not in a cool, horrifying way that communicates the tone of the scene, in a gross, ""I don't even want to look at this"" kind of way that made me want to stop watching.

Now, if you read my reviews of previous seasons, you'll notice all of these things existed in the series prior to this point. Those seasons made up for it with bombastic action scenes and powerful character moments. This season...doesn't. Okay, that's not completely true, Reiner got fleshed out a bit and it was pretty good, but that's literally it. The action was a major step down from previous seasons, the returning characters all get shoved to the background until the end, and the new characters...oh man do they suck.

So if the things that made previous seasons great are missing, surely they replace it with something equally engaging, right? Right? No. We spend a ridiculous amount of time with two brand new characters, Gabi, who is somehow a less interesting and nuanced version of Erin McYells-A-Lot from season 1, and Falco, who's somehow a less interesting and nuanced version of Reiner. To be fair, I actually like what they're trying to do with these two, demonstrate how hate and war are a cycle that will continue from generation to generation...unless individuals each choose the hard path to not seek revenge and stop the violence. This is actually beautifully demonstrated when a father chooses not to kill the soldier who murdered his daughter in order to set a good example for his other children. It is then immediately ruined when one of his children immediately tries to exact revenge themselves, rendering his noble action meaningless. Gabi and Falco are equally confusing, you can make the case Gabi is only the way she is because of the environment she was raised in, but Falco was raised in the same environment and came out completely different, so she really doesn't have an excuse, she just sucks as a human being. Is that the point the series? Some people just suck? I guess that's a valid idea, but is it an entertaining one? No.

And this is all just the surface level stuff I've been complaining about. The more you think about this season, the more it falls apart. Like how the 5 year time skip, and subsequent radical changes in personality, robs us of any connection we had to these characters, or how, at the end of the day, this whole season was almost completely pointless because they're still in the exact same situation they were in at the end of last season, except now the main character is an unlikable douchebag. So...if this season isn't fun to watch on a superficial level, and it's not engaging on a deeper level, what's good about it exactly? I genuinely can't tell.",2021-03-28T18:58:00+00:00,3
"Before anything. I want to say that all the 1 star reviews are lies. I've even seen one that said armin was too flat to be a girl. OI DID YOU WATCH THE ANIME. HE'S A DUDE. Yeah don't listen to them. I'm sorry if you had to read all the bullcrap in their comment, but you can bleach your eyes by reading this reveiw.     This review will contain spoilers for season 1-4, so please do not read if you haven't seen the anime/read the manga/don't care if you're spoiled.Very rarely you will find an anime that sparks something inside of you, that has an amazing story, plot, character development and more. This is just my opinion, so please do not get offended if my opinion is against yours.

Story: 11/10

       This story beings 2000 years after Ymir, where a little boy named Eren Yeager lives with Mikasa Ackerman and his parents Carla Yeager and Grisha Yeager. He has a friend named Armin Arlert, that doesn't have a lot of physical strength but his mind and intelligence are on another level. This should already be known by all. How they live in the walls, which for me is an amazing idea, Isayama Hajime apparently getting this idea from the mountains that surround his home town. I would have never thought that the eldian king from the continent made the walls Maria, Rose and Sina out of colossal titans. That's just a great idea! The way they introduced Annie to be the Female Titan was very impressive. At first I thought the show was about a little kid that would get powers and he would save humanity from the world with the power of friendship like most anime that you see  which is a pretty annoying trope. When I saw the female titan and realized there are more titan shifters that are against them, I said ''WOW'' out loud. Right after the Beast Titan Zeke is introduced, but we don't find out he's Eren's half brother till later. The second we find out that all those titans came from Connie's village, I was already half depressed. I realized that this show is nothing like what it started. It started with a little kid wanting revenge for his mother, but it just keeps taking twists and turns, not knowing what to expect next. After that, when we find out who the colossal titan and armored titan are, I said ''No f**king way. They're like some of my favorite characters that I respected so much'', and I'm sure I wasn't the only one that said that, unless you guys where spoiled and already knew. I usually hate politics, but season 3 part 1 was just wow. I've never liked politics this much, especially in an anime. The way the squad has to hide, how Eren is almost eaten, how he finds out what his father did, and judges him, at least until chapter 121. Then how Rod Reiss becomes that giant turkey was so funny, and at the same time scary. I usually put myself in their shoes, and think about what I would do if that was in real life, and as fearless as I am, seeing a titan that's twice the size of the colossal titan that destroyed my home, his intestines falling everywhere, I would have pooped my pants. This was also a very smart way to make Historia the queen, and the best part is where she hits Levi. Haha. Then when they recover wall Maria, it was another rollercoaster, not knowing what would happen. Armin becoming a colossal titan is something I would have never guessed, and there being even more titans, the Cart Titan showing up(damn she hot tho) it started awakening even more questions inside me, even though Eren already had known everything. When they finally get to the beach, people say Eren destroyed the mood by not enjoying anything and just wanting to kill the enemy, but I would have done the same if I knew freedom was on the other side, and this ocean is something that is stopping me. Another thing I didn't understand at the time is when Eren kissed Historia's hand, and all his memories come to life, him knowing everything that he has to do. When he finally shows up in season 4, as a person with PTSD that was helped by Falco I could not contain my grin, as I knew what was about to go down. The face on Falco when he was betrayed by him, and had to be protected by Reiner when Eren turned into the titan and started going berserk and killing everything. Lets not talk about the way he ate the warhammer titan, and how he smashed Porco to pieces. I'll stop right there, since I won't want to spoil the manga for anime only watchers, but I can say Isayama hates us, since he's killing all of our favorite characters. It made me almost want to drop the manga.


Art: 10/10

        There's not much to say about the art. At first it was animated by WIT studio, which was amazing, but they dropped the anime so MAPPA had to pick up where they left off. It got a little too much hate, and that's something I really didn't like, knowing that MAPPA only had 8 months to animate all of it, how they animated a lot of banger shows that everyone likes, but everyone forgot about them. For example they animated Yuri on Ice, Dororo, Jujutsu Kaisen, Kakegurui, Banana Fish and more.  Sure they use CGI, but the way they use it is absolutely AMAZING. I really hope they animate it fully, since this only had 16 episodes, and the manga has like 139 or 140 chapters (that's how many i think it will have, as we're only at chapter 136 as I make this post) and there's a pretty big chance that they won't be able to finish making everything into the anime, and if they don't I at least hope they make a movie that shows the ending. Their animation is WOW.


Sound: 11/10

        I have to give them an 11/10 for the soundtracks they chose and for the voice acting. Since the beginning of episode 1 season 1 they already had banger sound tracks. From the openings that everyone knows, even those that don't watch attack on titan, to OSTS like Vogel im Kafig, Attack on Titan or Rittaikidou. In season 4 the sound tracks are even better! For example one of the ones I really like is the Warhammer OST. The voice acting was wow since season one, since they have the same voice actors (or so I think, I have not checked yet). The feeling they put into the lines, the screams, the cries, the moments of happiness, the sighs, the betrayals, EVRYTHING is amazing. Each character has the exact voice that suits them.

Character: 11/10

         I don't want to talk too much about the characters, or I'd just make this post too long. I'll talk about a few that I really like.

Eren Yeager: Of course I'm going to start with our main character. I won't talk about Eren when he was young, as he was a child, and didn't have that much of a personality back then, and he had no experience. He still had emotions haha. Now in season 4, he has no facial expressions, he just seems dead inside. He seems as if thought he doesn't care about anything nor anyone, but everything he's about to do is for the family back home which isn't exactly back home, because everyone is there, fighting with him. He doesn't care about who dies if its not his friends, he just considers them the enemy, no matter if he's a man, woman or child. He's just a genius. At first I hated him, in other seasons, but the more he grew up, the more he realized the world is cruel. People judge him for what he is doing, you probably know that he want's to kill the whole world, and everyone calls him evil, but I think everyone would have done that if they were in his shoes. Would you rather kill the people from the other side that you don't know, or let your friends and family that you know and love die at the hands of strangers. Exactly. 

Mikasa Ackerman: Many people are screaming and saying Mikasa with short hair sucks, and they're blaming MAPPA for that, when Isayama made her look like that. Like what? In any case, as you can see, her first word in this season was ''Eren'', it seems like a meme by now. She's still mad in love with Eren, and tries to protect him so many times. We haven't seen her that many times in this season for now, but I'll say some things from the manga so I'm sorry if its a big spoiler for some. Just skip this if you don't like it. Even though they are telling Mikasa that she has to kill Eren and she knows she ahs to she still hesitates, which seems normal for someone that is in love with him.

Armin Arlert: He's a character I didn't like at first. He seemed like the type that would only act as if he knows nothing even though he does, just so that he can show off, but I learned that that was not the case. I'm sorry for my horrible thoughts about Armin UWU. Especially during episode 7, when he first became the colossal titan, I was like ''HOLY S**T! HE LOOKS SO EPIC OMG HOW DID I EVER HATE THIS GUY  OMG STEP ON ME DADDY'' yeah idk why. But I'm very very happy that I kept watching this anime heh.

Hange Zoe: We can't forget best girl (besides pieck) Hange Zoe. From the moment I saw her in season 1 I was super hyped about her, and I thought she was the type of person I want to become when I grow up, which is exactly why I never quit school haha. In this last season she's going to play a very big role, and I know it. I'm going to say something right now that is a very big spoiler, so please just skip reading this about Hange Zoe if you did not read the manga. Are the people that don't want to get spoiled gone? Ok perfect. Basically people blame Eren for her death. Yes, she died. You must know that if you kept reading. Eren did not intentionally kill her. I'm sure he's very sad that she died. I'm going to be adding these words so that the people that skipped don't see what i just said unless they wanted to get spoiled heh.

That's all I'm going to say about characters. Ofc I'd like to talk more about this anime and about the characters, so if you want to too, please just msg me.


Enjoyment: 11/10

       I've never enjoyed watching an anime as much as this one. I've seen  season 1-3  at least 9 times, and I read the manga god knows how many times. Everything, from the pacing to the plot was amazing. The pacing was fast during combat scenes, which was absolutely wow, and during suspense scenes the pacing was slow, which would make  me want to know what was going to happen even more. 


Overall: 11/10
       Taking everything into consideration everything that I just said, overall I give it an 11/10. Everything from the story, art, sound, character to enjoyment mix together to form this spectacular anime, that I recommend to everyone.",2021-01-26T03:15:00+00:00,10
the final season of attack on titan the finale attack on titan is my second fevoriet show of all time and my favoriet anime and the story is really great and the animation and i like how the anime changed after season 3 aot was my third anime and wow much changed in the anime and its just getting better i know this season gonna be great becuese i read the manga 10/10 anime the best anime ever if you didnt watch attack on titan i really Recommend thats i got say but the myanimelist say i need to write a longer review so,2021-01-01T12:33:00+00:00,10
"This is probably going to be my first and only review so please bare with me if there are any discrepancies.The animation is pristine, excellent usage of CGI thus far. Expect no less from the studio that has animated several big titles such as Jujutsu Kaisen, Zankyou no Terror, and Kakegurui.Story: 8/10Leaving off from the retake of Shiganshina arc we are introduced to a new set of characters who are chosen as the next ""warriors"" by Marley Empire. They are tasked with taking Fort Slava despite heavy casualties on the Marleyan side. After the battle one of our new characters as apart of the newrag tag crew of eldian warriors spot an injured soldier near a hospital and decides to converse with him after being called to sit down with him. After days of talking to eachother and Falco delivering letters for the injured soldier the soldier asks him to call upon his superior Vice Chief Braun to talk to him as they were apparently ""old friends"" to which he complies sitting at the back of the stage during a festival.

Art: 9/10

The CGI mixed in with the shot of titans descending from heaven is truly a masterpiece, expect no less from the very same studio that has animated several other successful shows in the past. However there are some scenes such as the beast titan looking a little bit out of place during the first episode when he is pitching rocks but it personally doesn't bother me that much.

Sound: 9/10

Though the opening isn't the best, the sound effect of guns blazing and the good usage of insert music throughout the scenes really makes up for the opening being not so good compared to season two and the rest of what we've seen from this show prior.

Characters: 9/10

So far as of the time of writing this review it's too early to determine whether these characters are ""likeable"" or ""lovable"" enough or even to be considered ""annoying."" I however, personally believe that Gabi Braun and her new cast of rag tag eldian ""warriors"" will prove to be more fleshed out as this season goes on especially with the character development they were given within 23 minutes of the first episode alongside the train ride back being hailed as heroes in the mid eastern war.


Enjoyment: 8/10

I really appreciate the good amount of work and production behind this show and I hope that the rest of the season won't disappoint. 

Overall; 8/10

Though some may say that this is a little too early to write a review and base the entire shows rating off of on a few good episodes, I myself, would like to take a gamble and say that this season is going to be a masterpiece and may very well be the new top anime of the decade.",2021-01-13T21:19:00+00:00,8
"Story: 10There are fans of a certain series giving attack on titan a 1 and some intellects giving it a score below 6. Now they can have there opinion (If they even watched it). But, Attack on titan. Started slow and now is going out with a BANG. AOT is one of the few animes. That gets better and better by season. How so? Well everything relies on the structural foundation of the story. Such as the foreshadowing. The foreshadowing really takes you by surprise they were made to be VERY obvious the past seasons. but you just couldn’t notice because you were caught upon something within the story and it caught you off guard. This allows it to keep surpassing it’s previous season because it builds something even bigger that makes even MORE sense. S4 is taking the all of the previous seasons theme’s and approaching you with the overall true theme of the story. (I hope)

(Artstyle: 10 / Animation: a 8.5 = 9.25)
Now I do notice a adequate drop in terms of animation. It has CGI it also has talking while walking. It really feels unnatural for such a prestigious anime like Attack On Titan! Im concerned about the monke titan and armored. However the art style is great MAPPA added lots of details to landscapes and character design making them absolutely stunning and whatnot looks a lot better than the manga! They did cut off some scenes in the manga but the directing of S4 is great.

Sound: 10
The music composition matches with the theme or feeling. It makes you invested it’s such a rich OST!!

Character: 10
As the story is getting darker they explore every characters situation there pass and give them immense characterization. Such as, Reiner and others.
Eren becomes such a compelling protagonist he does everything and strives for his goal in a satisfying way. No other protagonist can give off the vibe he does! He plans things out in a brilliant way. However there are some very weak characters, Levi is quite overrated and so is Mikasa. However we do get to learn very interesting things about them. They shouldn’t be given a lot of attention for there character. SO PUT THEM OUT YOUR FAVORITES AND PUT EREN.

Enjoyment: 10
Waiting a week for attack on titan is the same pain as waiting a month for a chapter! I guess this give you an idea how much I catch up on attack on titan through the manga. So imagine watching through the anime! ALSO! Attack on titan final season broke crunchyroll servers... that’s some real hype

Day 1: 17 chapters
Day 2: 20 chapters
Day 3: 8 chapters",2021-01-12T23:05:00+00:00,10

"This will be a spoiler-free review. I will be writing this including all seasons, not just this one. If you've never watched AoT or Shingeki no Kyojin, maybe you started the first season and like me, you thought ""wow this is incredibly slow"" and wanted to stop watching it and almost did until one of your friends tells you ""DO NOT STOP"". listen to them. The story is fantastic. There is really no other words to describe it, the writers did a phenomenal job. While season1  starts off slow for the first few episodes trust me it picks up fast after that. The animation:there are some animes where the animation starts off good and gets lazy near the end, think dragon ball super, this is not the case here. It is beautiful from episode 1 to the last episode in season 4 ep 5 at the time of writing. 

Characters: Without giving away too much you will see several years of character development and characters from S1 that you may hate really change in the later seasons. 

If you are watching this from the start as a first-time watcher, you are incredibly lucky that you won't have to wait a week for a new episode until you catch up. There are 11 episodes left in the final season and this last one was a banger. 

Dubs V Subs. I have watched seasons 1-3 both ways. The voice acting is great in both, but IMO the JP voice acting is better. If you do plan on binge-watching I suggest the English voices only because you may not be 100% focused at all times and you can miss some important dialogue. 

You are in for a real treat being able to watch such a great show for the first time.",2021-01-12T00:40:00+00:00,10
"I'll come to the heart of the matter. There are various reasons why Attack on Titan is perhaps the best anime to actually be delivered ever. Beginning on livelinesss, it is simply unimaginable they have made such distinctive scenes. It seems like each casing is painstakingly drawn, and the battle takes the crowd in another point as though they are encountering it as well. With regards to characters each character has a task to carry out in specific circumstances and Isayama has conveyed. The manga is staggering, associating bits of the past and the future uniting the present. In the event that you've perused themanga, at that point you as of now have understand what's coming will be nothing not exactly perfect shounen dramatization arrangement you'll actually watch. I'm not going to imagine that the arrangement isn't monstrously well known yet the publicity is only a small amount of what it is, which is a disgrace on the grounds that with this later season the arrangement has advanced and changed such a lot of that as somebody who's at first tepid about the arrangement, I think where it is correct now it turning out to be the best anime of the cutting edge age(I don't plan to utilize those words daintily). 

Story ~ 10 

What makes it an extraordinary arrangement is that it doesn't follow regular narrating , so that implies that anything can occur whenever. There are a bigger number of turns than titans in this arrangement so there are a not many possibilities that you can foresee something occurring. Sort of like Game of Thrones. 

The characters in Attack on Titan don't fall into any generalization all things considered. For instance a feeble character could become more grounded or a solid character could show shortcoming. At times, an apparently irrelevant character could out of nowhere turned into a central participant later on in the story. 

Workmanship ~ 9 

The visual movement by Wit Studio is a work of acclaim. I could locate some other studio to deal with this anime. The liveliness is staggering and it worked really hard to make the titan alarming and awfulness once again.As soon as I heard that MAPPA was going to assume control over I was kinda stressed what they would think about this arrangement however I surmise those concerns disappeared when I had the opportunity to see a couple of scenes. 

Sound ~ 9 

The music has it's own taste to it where as the visuals of both the opening and the consummation appeal to you from numerous points of view. The initial melody simply acquires an orchestra of such a smoothness and unexpected dread inside and out. 

Characters ~ 10 

There's not a lot to be said with regards to the characters everybody surpasses themselves the their improvement is immaculate indeed.No one leaves their limits to accomplish something shocking. 

Pleasure ~ 10 

Initially I planned to compose a short survey on how great the new season will be, at that point the more I chipped away at it the more I understood I truly couldn't do equity without discussing the whole excursion every individual who has each watched this show to arrive. Since each season is so immeasurably extraordinary that it adds on to the generally speaking experience.Because it's my method of saying that you should drop everything since this season is totally justified, despite any trouble. 

By and large ~ 10 

Assault on Titan is an unquestionable requirement show for anybody if they appreciate anime. The writing in this show is extraordinary, you should watch it to trust it. The story is dull however lovely, and the movement is the best anime has to bring to the table. The show has an incredibly decent speed, with a mix of horrible tense activity scenes and ardent character minutes. The characters in this show are so exceptional and unmistakable, each character feels genuine and three dimensional, in spite of their intermittent senseless anime style chitchat (which is engaging in its own right). The soundtrack is likewise among the best any TV program has created, and it communicates the tones of the show and makes each scene far superior. 'Vogel im Kafig' is a melodic work of art, and I suggest you give it a listen regardless of whether you haven't seen the show. The show's exciting bends in the road are on another level, and the uncovers are fabricated well to the point that each plottwist will leave your jaw on the floor. This show is really a work of art, and you should see it. It is fundamentally a developed substance show and on the off chance that you are grown-up there is no disgrace in watching anime.",2021-01-11T15:22:00+00:00,10
"Attack on Titan is one of the most overhyped pieces of anime in recent history. Don't get me wrong, I still think the anime is quite good, with an array of good qualities to its name, but there is no doubt that it is overhyped. If you have any doubt, just take a gander at all the reviews with instant 10/10s after only watching 3 episodes, or the constant praise it gets on MAL and on social media, all of which have led me to write this review. A little about my experience with AoT: I watched the first season of the anime weekly whenit first came out, read the manga and watched the new seasons as they came out, and recently just finished rewatching the whole thing (right before season 4 released). Though, I did drop the manga a while ago. 

Sound - 8.5/10

I do think AoT series has quite the good soundtrack. No issues here.

Art - 7/10

Edit: In light watching the 6th episode of the anime, I lowered my rating of ""art"" to 7/10, and subsequently my overall rating also from 8 to 7/10. The CGI was atrocious, especially the 3D maneuver gear. The scouts looked terrible, and for some reason different from the manga.

Story - 6/10 

To me, the story is about the worldbuilding, the storytelling, and the execution. Without a doubt, in the beginning AoT had amazing worldbuilding with good execution, but I always questioned its storytelling. Right from the beginning, it heavily relied on plot twists and cliffhangers, almost to the point of dependency. It came to the point where it felt like the author could not progress the story without a twist somewhere in there. Plot twists are generally really good, especially if done well. However, too much of anything is bad, especially if it's not even done well or lazy in the case of some of the plot twists in AoT, particularly the basement reveal. I was not a big fan of the direction the anime suddenly took in that reveal. 

Although the execution was good in the beginning, it felt like it slowly degraded throughout the show, particularly around the middle. There came a point where each time a new manga chapter (or anime episode, if you were watching weekly) came out, I would have to look for someone on reddit or in the comments to summarize and explain what the episode was talking about, in addition to providing background information to what those points were about. I don't have a bad memory, I promise you, AoT is just that convoluted and complex for no god damn reason. It is not a problem if you binge it, but that's a fallacy in of itself. Basically, alongside the aforementioned point of bad/excessive plot twists, it creates this feeling of fake hype, where you're only really into it if you're binging it or watching it with friends. 

Just compare AoT's storytelling and execution to something that's ACTUALLY good at the storytelling aspect, like Oda's One piece, Masaaki's Yojouhan/Ping Pong, or FMA B

Characters - 4/10 

I mean, I know some might disagree, but yeah. The characters are simply not that great. Eren is obnoxious, Historia is trash, Reiner is a deux ex machina, Annie is poorly written, Mikasa is one dimensional. Levi &amp; Armin are decent, Erwin is great. Everyone else is irrelevant or just comic relief. Aside from Erwin, each character is simply a plot tool or one dimensional, generic, has no character development, or poorly written. I particularly hate Erin because his character is heavily inconsistent while his motivation and morality is questionable at best. Not really into an MC who is insane, inconsistent, and also doesn't know right from wrong.

Yes, I think the characters are the worst aspect of the show. To be honest, it shouldn't be a surprise. Think about it for a little, compare it to other anime that ACTUALLY have good characters. Just look at Tengen Toppa, Steins;Gate, Ping Pong, or Psycho Pass. ACTUAL bad ass characters that Levi could never compare to, ACTUAL character development, ACTUAL depth, TOP TIER execution. I mean AoT could never compare

Enjoyment - 5.5/10 

The show was enjoyable at one point, particularly in the earlier seasons where the direction was resolute and the plot was world-driven. Now, it's driven by the aforementioned mediocare and below average characters, which makes the enjoyment and story significantly less enjoyable. 

Overall - 6/10 

In short, the show is decent, just overhyped. Definitely doesn't deserve a 10/10, or a spot in the top 30 on MAL, at least in my opinion. At the end of the day, just take a break from all the hype and actually compare it to other good anime. You think the action aspect is good? The characters? The style? just compare it to Gurren Lagann, One Piece, Hunter x Hunter, Mob Psycho or FMA B. They're all action, and AoT just pales by comparison. I'm not trying to be an elitist, just stop being a sheep and use your brain. I can write an essay about how good Gurren Lagann's characters are, but I don't think I could write a small paragraph about AoT's characters without keeping a straight face. From cringing. Erwin is goated tho. GGs",2021-01-15T03:19:00+00:00,6
"the final season of the acclaimed franchise ""shingeki ni kyojin"", super popular and well rated on this site, but it seems that people cannot see its flaws(translated by google translator)story: 5.5/10It's simple, since the anime wants to have more fights and plot twists, the forced and illogical script, but an interesting thing is that the work has two sides in which neither of them is 100% certain, being something interpletive, a very good thing for a work of the genre, of course it is worth mentioning the improvement in the characters (something fundamental for the story)Characters: 4/10as said, and I repeat: shingeki no kyojin wantsmore to have fights and plot twists, because it pleases the audience more, leaving important things like characters aside, few of them are useful, Levi, mikassa, Sasha, Jean are posts on the other hand Reinier has a certain deepening, and Erem, too? I would even say yes, if your personality change was not forced. Worst of all is that the work still tries to have dramatic scenes with such useless characters, I get businessman that there are people who cry in episode 8

Art 6/10
Superior to other seasons, the color palette is much less ""brown"", whew, but it still has simple designs ... the only and great positive point is the faces of the titans,who are scary and ghastly, feeling a sense of danger and threat

sound 7/10
Great sound effects, soundtrack too, but a scene would be much better with an OST that they didn't put ...

Enjoyement 6/10
despite the defects the anime has good fights, animation and direction very correct, it is a good entertainment ...

overall 6/10

I recommend it more for action fans, because the work has many defects and is very overrated ....",2021-02-13T15:09:00+00:00,6
"So recently my review got taken down for fair reasoning, so I decided to rewrite my review so I solely focus on more of the actual show itself than just shitting on the community for no good reason. This wall of text has been edited.So let me start off by saying I do like Attack On Titan I think the first few seasons are really good examples on the anime and manga medium but as we all know the most recent season dropped. Dropped hard. At first, I didn’t think there was much wrong with it just a little awkward CG and sort of weirdaudio mixing but other than that eh it was a decent start. 

Then after the Attack On Marley episodes started airing, is when my problem soon started to rise. The Warhammer Titan. The animation of the Warhammer Titan is not good. Not good at all. Actually the titans in general are extremely poorly animated. Also just as a side note I really dislike the animation of the opening I just want something cool but let’s be real it was pretty lazy. The song is a fucking bop but the actual animation of it is really disappointing compared to literally any other AOT Opening. The animation overall is poor. It isn't good. While I understand the schedule and how unfortunate it is, but I am reviewing what I am seeing and what I am seeing is weird line work, sloppy movement, terrible fight scenes, and even bad character models. It is bad. Very bad.

The sound also really disappointing. Now let’s start off with the Soundtrack or the lack there of. There is literally just no good tracks besides from one they overused in the trailer. They don’t even utilise the best part of the song but they just overuse it for the sort of “ oh cool “ sort of stuff not the “HOLY SHIT” stuff. I remember screaming that at the reveal in AOT S2. The soundtrack was popping in my ears and it was just a good time. Though it’s not here that same feeling just isn’t here. Songs like ' You See Big Girl ' or other amazing tracks are barely used. Those are the tracks that personally get me going. They get me excited. Why am I not excited?

The story. Ok here is one of the problems with AOT itself. The story is a bit wonky. I feel 90% of the time AOT doesn’t know what it wants to be. Like it was a mystery survival horror which was what got me into the series then it wants to be a human vs human struggle which was fine. BUT NOW WE ARE STRAIGHT UP MILITARY STRUGGLE. Like damn. I think I just really miss the mystery of the show to be honest. Lets not even talk about the shit ass underuse of so many characters. Armin has literally done nothing all series besides from the last chapter it took him over 137 chapters to do something. Mikasa who had a fucking brand that we had no idea about no hint it was just there. That’s just fucking lazy. Plus she also does nothing but be like damn Eren for the whole series so cool. Levi. I like Levi but god damn I want him to do more cool shit. Eren is fine. All the side characters like Jean, Connie and others to me feel under-utilised as well who are just in and out of existence. A lot of characters just feel half baked.

Ok now the main reason why I wrote the original review the community. Now don’t get me wrong I can respect extremely passionate people about anime or manga, I am exactly like this with Berserk and I will not lie I have had arguments with people before over Berserk. However the overwhelming amount of Love and Hate this series gets is staggering. Look it’s not a life-changing masterpiece, but it is also not a extremely shit series with no substance. It is somewhere in between. Now I personally hate seeing ships in any series they just gross me out since it’s taking away from the source material of the story but when people ship Zeke and Levi or Eren it’s just annoying and gross man. There has been no indication of them having any sort of romance thing going on and it’s very fucking weird when people are into that shit. I don’t ship characters because I think it takes away from a lot of the stories because it is not what the original mangaka intended. Like shipping Griffith and Guts because of their backstories no. That’s not how it works. Plus the passionate some people put into the series is really off-putting and once again I am like this with Berserk to a fault but it is a lesson we need to learn. That while we love our anime and manga we need to just let people have their own opinion and if they are willing to discuss then discuss but if not just leave it you don’t need to validate your own opinion but changing someone’s else’s. 

Overall AOT doesn’t deserve the immense amount of hate but it also doesn’t deserve the immense amount of love it is just somewhere in the middle. Be reasonable with your reviews folks it’s not 1 but it is definitely not 10. There are many problems within the story itself and with the fanbase but that is any anime to be fair. Thanks for reading.",2021-02-18T17:58:00+00:00,6
"I am intending to watch the remaining episodes. There are some minor spoilers here.I see a lot of 10/10 reviews, some which were written after a few episodes. It is amply clear how deluded many AoT fans are based on the various perfect scores that were given after like 2 or 3 episodes. The AoT fanbase is so toxic and aggressive that most normal fans would be reluctant to  give 10/10 out of spite. But that is unfair... I am not that petty. However, even on a technical level, AoT is not a 10/10, and it is not the best thing since sliced breadas many hardcore fans will tell you.

I have watched 10 episodes so far, and it has been underwhelming, seeing that many people waited for ages. The hype was palpable, and many people waited eagerly, but the anime falls short of the expectations. 

We are in the final season, and yet we still barely care for characters like Mikasa, Armin and even the talented Levi. Eren has changed a lot, and Mikasa has become less stoic now,  but most of the characters leave much to be desired. Levi is pretty much the same. Armin is more composed than he was in in season 1, but he is still boring. Honestly, if any of these characters were to die, I'd not care one bit.. Shocking.

The plot is just needlessly convoluted now. The political angle is quite boring. Compare this to the excitement that season 1 brought. In season 1, the whole world was more confined and interesting. There was a genuine sense of claustrophobia, mystery and danger. Now, we have something like Game of Thrones. The anime has simply lost its charm by taking the plot in this direction. I suspect that many fans also feel betrayed by the angle this anime took. A WW3-type titan apocalypse with advanced militaries  is not what many of us wanted...

Also, it is irritating how the main characters seem to be protected by insane plot armour despite the anime trying to be like a seinen that is set in a dangerous world. The main characters can effortlessly maneuver around in their ODM  while dodging machine gun attacks... They must be as good as Neo from the Matrix. Fodder characters die, and a lot of time is wasted to make you feel sad... How can you feel sad for a character that barely did anything important across the seasons? 

A lot of suspension of belief is required during fights now. For example, Mikasa is able to sever both legs of a titan with one clean cut, as though those thick legs were made of cake. It's unbelievable. In season 1, it took all of Levi's team to make Annie drop her arms (not sever), and now Mikasa can conveniently chop off an important titan's legs so that Eren can finish the fight... Also, one titan had a laughable extension cord growing out from its heel, which was a major handicap (it made no sense) that screamed ""Hello. My weakness is here!"".

We are 10 episodes in, and I can quite confidently say that this anime has lost the charm it possessed in season 1. Even without the toxic fanbase, I could not give this anime a 9. The expanded scale of the AoT universe has now weakened the tense dynamics that we found beforehand when it was about surviving behind the walls. 

The anime is still above average, and the action is sometimes great... However, there is still a lot of exposition and annoying monologue. 

Lower your expectations when watching this anime. Have fun.",2021-02-15T12:17:00+00:00,7
"WORDS NO LEFT TO BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS LEGENDARY, PIECE OF ARTWORK. STORY: First, I will start talking about this unbelievable story. I always have to go back to the previous eps to check what happened there in order to understand what is actually going on this final season. the storylines are incredible, it's like I am reading a legendary play and not just an anime. each word has a deep meaning to the point that you can't even dare to ignore a line because you will miss a thousand things and facts. I give it 10 though I want to give it the wholeuniverse because this story deserves more.



ART: I gave it 9 because I know that if MAPPA had time to work on aot the work will be more professional than that. However, this does not mean that I did not like their work and their art. I am so thankful for Mappa to give us this art in one year only, and I am also hoping to see some better changes and development in these coming episodes.

ADDITION: after episode8 I cannot dare to give them 9, their literary deserve 10 out of 10.  the way they let the viewer feel what the characters are passing with through their facial expressions, is making me live the hole episode and the hole anime. I am so thankful to mappa for giving us a chance to see these scenes being animated. 



SOUNDS: I hope I am able to give it a never-ending number because, Eren's voice, Reiner's voice, and other voices were amazing. I felt each word they said, each breathe and sigh they did. I literary felt like I am with them in the hole episode. I am highly fired up to listen to all their voices without stop in these next episodes. 


OST: is there a word to describe aot's osts? Of course NO! I am always amazed how they choose the right sounds, the right melodies to let the audience feel the scene more. and I always end up crying or screaming because this is what I just wanted to do. I all advise u to hear them in full version right after you finish this season okkaaay ?? 


I will stop here to not give any spoiler, but overall I am so proud of living in this time and watch this masterpiece and be in its generation",2021-01-15T05:00:00+00:00,10
"Mods please remove the obvious trolls and rating tankers in the review section who call this series ""shit"" and ""crap"" without any further explanation.As for my own review I initially thought of this series as a generic shonen back when s1 came out. I had to catch up on the series when I saw the s4 trailer and it blew me away. The plot evolves each and every season and s4 seems like a whole different universe while at the same time staying coherent to the previous seasons. Composer Sawano's soundtrack is legendary and I hope to see more of his work that will berevealed as the season progresses. If this season is too fast paced for you, I would suggest reading the manga in order to truly understand the background of the relationship between Marleyans and Eldians. Visually, I did not notice the cgi until it was pointed out, which is the same case with earlier seasons.

Overall, don't let others dictate how you view the series and enjoy the titan-on-titan slugfest.",2021-01-24T18:37:00+00:00,10
"Disclaimer: I love the source material, I think this is a nasty adaptation.Tldr for this review, the animation is balls.The first season of attack on titan came out when I was in 8th grade, now I'm 20. I love this series a great deal and season 3 was so good I went and read the manga. Of course the trouble with that is I no longer get the enjoyment of finding out what happens in the show, and so I am forced to critique the adaptation rather than the story it's based on since I already know it. When I'm watching a show and theanimation or direction is so bad it takes me out of what's happening, I like to play a game. I count how many shots and how much time elapses between still frame/cgi and animation. With this season, I find myself doing it at least once an episode, and the results are sad. I find that on average there is one slightly animated shot every 30 secs to a minute (characters head shifting while talking, character running but you don't see their legs) and no actual animation. Remember all those cool shots of Levi flying all over the place from earlier seasons? dead, no more. The scouts and titans are now 100% CGI except for still frames, and the Titans are CGI in still frames as well. 
I'm no CGI elitist, I didn't care about CGI in the earlier seasons cause it was used sparingly and looked good or at least passible, and the gorgeous 2d animation compensated. Everything looks so fucking goofy now, I can't take anything seriously with the way things look. Nothing fucking moves, this is the biggest anime of the year and it looks like shit. MAPPA is capable of making it look good, look at the animation in GoHS or Jujutsu Kaisen. Worst of all everyone is closing their eyes and saying it doesn't look like shit and calling everyone who says it looks like shit a ""CGI elitist."" 
In conclusion, 
Fuck you MAPPA bye bye, I torrent all my anime anyways.

Watch this if you don't have time to read the manga
4/10 for now",2021-01-27T19:23:00+00:00,4
"Yea! Attack on titan is getting season 4. Yes! This is what is going on and on in the fans that they lost all sense of sanity. If you stay hungry for several days you will the food even if it tastes worst. Attack on titan is just like that. The fans were so desperate that they have become just like those mindless titans. The author thinks he is a god so he can do whatever he wants now that his work is so popular. Yeah! the first three seasons of Attack on titan was so good. The plot, the characters and the animation wasall top notch. So he arrogantly made it more intense by adding shit type scenes and reversing characters. But believe me! The fans will take toxic if it is in the show or in the plot. Toxic fans.

Plot is reversed. More insanity. Until the 3rd season it was edible. But now it is out of hand. So much hatred and unnecessary edgy contents for no good reasons. So much sick mentality. Sick contents. Making it look like it is the most right thing to do. 

The art and sound are both good. The animation is good. But compared to studio wit. It is slightly weaker. But really good for the cheap plot. MAPPA did a great job here. i really appreciate it. But like I said before after the third seasons the author along with the fans have got mad. So fans threatened the studio. Such insanity. No one in right mind complain about animation that is this good. 

Characters were good. But now most of them are dead. And the rest are destroyed. Well the author wanted to kill all of the characters. So instead of killing all. He made the rest destroyed. I mean mikasa, Eren,.......so on. 

I didn't enjoy least beat this season. I won't be able to enjoy it all since I am well acquainted with the manga. But still until the third season it was really great. But now it is really bad. 

My overall rating of this show is really bad. IT WAS REALLY GOOD. BUT NOW IT IS BAD. SO i WILL SAY BAD. NOT LIKE THOSE MINDLESS TITAN LIKE TOXIC FANS. Who will eat shit if it is put in the Attack on titan show. 
The show is now a wasted effort.",2021-02-05T05:20:00+00:00,2
"***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***""Who are the reals harmed by man's conflicts?""The main change between the previous seasons and this 4th season (besides the studio has changed, of course) is this look of cause and consequence of the effects of a war. Of course, in previous seasons there was also such a discussion, but that is not where the anime guided its events. Tetsurou Akira's management was not so interested in debating any scares. Yuuichirou Hayashi on the other hand turns all the events of the anime into an (almost perfect) allegory.Eren's character made me question his actions and real intentions at all times. The optionto show in the first episodes that there are also humans in Marley, as in Paradis, helps to reinforce this feeling of non-impunity to the character's actions. The anime was brilliant in some scenes in the attack on Marley explicitly showing innocent people being killed in the middle of a confrontation. Even the way it is framed has also changed. He gained this more threatening climate, almost always covered by a shadow, as if he were always hiding or repressing something.

Gabi's character made me have that same feeling of questioning from Eren, only in her case more as a new victim. The character grew up, trained and was taught in this context and scenario to believe that her enemies were literally heartless demons. In fact, if we think about it, the two characters are victims of this situation. It is obvious that in the case of Eren, we follow even more personally (in relation to the first season) so it is normal to get a little more attached to his side. The actions and reactions of the two mediators to this are also extreme, so I say that I can feel pity and repudiation for both of them (in relation to their actions).

It is also visible that the characters around him also suffer the consequences for their actions. Sasha and other Paradis soldiers died because of Eren's attack. And then the poor Falco. All the choices made by Gabi practically fell on him.

But a lot of things bothered me in this final SNK season, starting with the anime I don't have a clear direction. Blame it may have been the timing problem faced by the new studio. When I talk about this problem, I'm not talking about the animation (let's face it, it was below compared to previous seasons, but that doesn't matter to me). The director took a more serious stance, but does not seem to have let go of some things from previous seasons, or did not have a very sensitive eye to define how he would adapt the work.

Starting with this “Eren villain”. Where in the action scenes, the character still seemed to me a hero when he shouldn't be. Okay, the anime shows the consequence of his actions with the innocent around him, but while the character is acting, the anime still dynamizes such actions a lot. It even seems that the anime shows a certain appreciation for the violence of the character, which ends up going against this moral that the anime wants to show. The final scene of episode 14 where Commander Pixes is beaten by the soldiers shows a disgust and contestation for the acts, unlike when Eren beats Armin. With those camera movements that follow the dynamics of the character throwing the punches, as if anime would put us in that action in a pleasurable way.

The anime may have gained that more serious tone in order to discuss a specific theme, but the characters have not lost that most hilarious characteristic of other seasons. Perhaps by the direction of T. Akira, who had that more dynamic and relaxed side, it worked. There was a breaking effect between violence and comedy, but it doesn't work here. The direction of Y. Hayashia conflicts with this more serious side that wants to discuss something with these jokes that come out of nowhere without any sensitivity. Sasha's death that I mentioned earlier had no bearing on me.

The subtext of the anime is also another problem. If I am going to praise, on the one hand, the anime can, through the events, divide the viewer on this analogy to war, on the other, the expository and unnecessary dialogues devalue this structure very much. The conversation between Gabi and Kaya about a possible “historical heritage” of the events of the war was ashamed of how obvious and expository it was. If the anime is showing us such a situation through the narrative, it does not need to reinforce telling us more. To summarize, the anime underestimates the interpretive capacity and the viewer's relationship with the implicit theme.

In conclusion, I don't think this season was the best of SNK, but it wasn't the worst either. He even tried to build an ambiguity in his main narrative, but he made some choices that ended up going against the very moral of his discussion.",2021-04-06T17:29:00+00:00,5
"As the penultimate arbiter of truth I hereby inform you that Shingeki no Kyojin is amazing, the final arc is unbelievable and therefore......you should quit being a pleb and go read the manga! Trust me, you won't be disappointed, there's even a colored version.Update: Episodes 5, 6 and 7 have now dropped and the animation quality dropped with it. Episode 6 was pretty cringey with the bad CGI and the reason I mention episode 5 is because the OST choice started to suck with that episode and continued to feel flat through the following episodes.What I wrote below holds true for the earlier seasons. Thisseason is inferior to the manga. Go read the manga.



If you want a bit more details, the anime adaptation is superb, from the soundtrack to the animation. It is mostly faithful to the manga and is, in my opinion, superior to the manga, mostly because of the soundtrack. Even though the anime is superior, I still recommend you to read the manga which has only three chapters left and rid yourself of the anxiety of waiting a week (or 2) for each episode and then to have a long pause waiting for the inevitable second part to the season for it won't fit in a single part. This is from a guy who binged the first three seasons, then waited for the final one and after the fourth episode couldn't wait two weeks to see the first real confrontation.

You can still watch the anime after you read the manga.

Enjoy.


P.S. If you still won't read the manga, you should watch Steins;Gate, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu or read the Solo Leveling light novel in the meantime.",2021-01-05T12:26:00+00:00,10
"To say i like aot is like i saying like date a live (i don't like date a live). We all know that aot is one of the most overrated anime of all time and one of the most worst anime that been ever created. All right but how about this season... This season is not only the worst but also i think it just destroyed aot than before but okay let's startthe firsr thing i don't like about this season is the fact that it has worse animation than the previous seasons well at least the last seasons had pretty good animation but thisone? this has poor animation which looks bad and cgi which we all know looks bad.

the second thing i don't like is eren... like he was already bad character, why he became even worse character. His plans are so incomprehensible and so bland that while watching this season i think ""why does he even exist"" i just don't get why eren is the character in this season.

the third and last thing i don't like about this season is boredom. literally when i'm watching this i didn't say ""wow this is good"" or ""wow that was epic"". Literally in first 5 episodes nothing happens but after 5 episode it gets ""interesting"" but then again this anime become boring and i wonder what this anime finnaly suppposed to be.

All right so in summary this season is the worst out of all aot, no interesting, tragic animation and boredom.",2021-03-11T05:06:00+00:00,1
"We are always expecting the best from Shingeki no kyojin. Still, this season won't be at our expectations. a lot of CGI; they use the traditional drawing when the camera close up to some char or titan but always using the CGI, this applies to the fights, but familiar scenes are always with the drawing.I started with the art as it's the only bad thing this season. The sound is quite acceptable. Also, I won't talk about the story as it's the best; I mean, what do you expect from AoT. AoT provides the best drama and psychological ideas.The other issue we have here ishow this studio would combine all the remaining chapters from the mange to the anime. It's impossible; I read the manga, but the last arc is full of new chars, and a unique style in telling the story also needs a genius to make this anime narrators this fantastic story. I hope they end this art with a movie because it will take like two years to be done as what I saw from the last arc to provide us with the best ending as their only issue this season is the time.

I do think this studio is drawing the last arc while giving us a piece of shit which is the CGI. If that was what they are doing, then they will participate in that big legend with WIT.

To sum up, if you want to have absolute enjoyment with this season, don't think of anything but put yourself in these characters' positions. Consider if you were in their place, what would you do. But if you can't do this, then read the manga; it will be better, I guess. I mean, I prefer the manga over the anime. Remember that AoT isn't the anime of this season, but jujutsu kaisen is what we all wait for.",2021-01-18T06:42:00+00:00,5
"a pile of trash, the animation and execution are no different from those trash isekai seriesin part is understable, since they didn't have enough time to manufacturer a good series, the previous studio dropped the production since they didn't let to them enough time, while other studios refuse to do such work in that short amount of time, here comes mappa studio, who can yes produce it faster, but the results are equal to trashthere is an overuse of anime japanese studio quality cgi, meaning that's bad cgi, japanese studios usually do use cgi to cut down on cost/time, and the results are pretty bad,the camera placement is boringly static, and flat, and sometimes feels like they badly played with the camera keys/curvature, it's too fast

meanwhile the 2d animation remains scarce, the camera is always in flat position, the characters are barely animated, and often they do put in static images with some camera movements to give the allusion of an animated scene, all things that we can usually find in trash/poor budget production

the osts.. they mainly have recycled the ost of previous series, other ones are from those generic ost that you can find in stock/license free resources, also often they feel missplaced, such as they didn't really took the time to do a proper video editing job

for the story of it, I have nothing to say, from now it seems that's following the manga, but just concentrating into the story for an animation media, for me it's dumb, animation is the main part of such medium, however if I should give a score for the story I would give 6, since it seems that they are following the manga, I have nothing to say about the story",2021-02-09T11:54:00+00:00,3
"I honestly have no idea why this show is anywhere near the top much less the second highest rated show on this platform.The first 3 seasons were good but this one really drops the ball in my opinion. And no I'm no complaining about the CGi. It's not perfect but it can easily be overlooked if there was a good story behind it. And in my opinion the final season of attack on titan doesn't have it.I would have waited until all of the season is out to make up my mind about it, but when the first half of it already it out andit's this bad I really don't see how the rest can do literally anything to salvage it.

My biggest problem has to be the stupid time skip they added. Don't get me wrong. Time skips can work. But not like this. The first time we even see the main cast is like 5 episodes in to the season and they're changed to the point that I honestly can't bring myself to care about any of them. Characters changing and developing is usually a good thing but the difference here is that I didn't get to witness any of the change and growth. So these people are like completely new characters that barely resemble the main cast I've been following for the past 3 seasons. With how they're spent they're time I literally care and know more about Gabi, Falco and the rest of the new characters than the people who I'm supposed to have spent 3 seasons getting to know.

Yes, the fight scenes were cool. But they would have been just as cool as a clip on YouTube with absolutely no context. I will probably still finish it just because I have nothing better to do with my weekend but if you for example have some anime in you're ""to watch"" list. Then go watch those instead of wasting your time with this show.",2021-02-03T06:46:00+00:00,4
"Look how they massacred my boyEverything got worse in this season. I'm just really sad with happened with this anime.You can barrely notice that the music is there. It's absolutelly meh.The animation is awful. It seems that the dialogue scenes received more attention than the fights.The story got worse but it's bearable at least. The worst part is the pace of the anime, it's almost frozen, nothing happens on the epsodes. My gf sometimes couln't watch and I was able to condense everything that happened in 1 or 2 sentences.There is nothing more to say about this, so here goes MAL rules",2021-03-30T16:31:00+00:00,4
"Oh boy. Possibly the most over-rated series this season by a long shot. As someone who has enjoyed the Shingeki series quite a bit I was so disappointed by this final season, and I really don't understand why it's receiving such raving reviews. #2 of all time? Really? It's going to be a sad day when this inevitably overtakes FMA Brotherhood in the #1 spot that's for sure.Where to begin... there's so many things I dislike about this season.The majority of this season follows the story of side characters we've never seen before and honestly don't care about at all. Most them are extremely one-dimensionaland very dislikeable with few redeeming qualities. What little screen time the main characters get is super underwhelming and none of them are even remotely the same people from the previous seasons. This season may as well have been a totally separate cast from a different point in time.

The story is a mess and really uninteresting. The exciting action between humans and titans is basically non-existent and is replaced by boring politics. Perhaps reading the manga makes the story good, but if your anime requires the viewer to go out of their way to do extra research on the side then honestly it's just bad writing.

The art is pretty bad in comparison to the previous season. This is largely due to a different studio handling this final season. Shingeki already suffered terribly from character individuality and MAPPA really haven't done a good job making characters unique. Everyone has the exact same face.

The sound is fine I suppose. The theme songs suck though.

All in all very disappointing. Give it a watch so you can add it to your list but it's far from the masterpiece the fans are making it out to be.",2021-03-29T00:56:00+00:00,5
"I see many 9-10/10 reviews and I cannot fathom to see how anyone comes to that conclusion.  I'm not one to hate just for the sake that its a popular show, but I can't help but to side with the haters in agreement that this is the most overrated show ever aired to date, really, 9.15 average?  This season is the most confusing, incoherent, uninspired season to date.  This is a prime example of how 'complicated' does not mean insightful, deep, or anything genuinely interesting.First off, you can tell there must have been some budget cuts in so many instances and negativelyimpacts the show: 
1. Incredible amount of dialogue from behind character's heads 
2. CGI fight scenes that don't blend well into the rest of the animation 
3. Scenes were character animations are actual mistakes that somehow slipped by 
..I could go on, about all the blurred background scenes, windows with only light (no outside views) coming through etc but I'll stop here.  Instead of filling their pockets, they should have paid more animators to do a better job.

Character design in both the artistic and personality sense are both outrageously bad.  EVERYONE has a grave expression on their face at every waking moment for some reason.  This obviously diminishes the meaningfulness of that expression for the moments where its justified and just makes everyone look like bitter annoying characters.  The new characters are not unique artistically in any way and it becomes a struggle just to remember each of their significance.  And with our old cast of characters, we have undergone some personality changes which fundamentally clash with their previous character growth/deep rooted connections, meanwhile some characters remain unchanged artistically as if they didn't age with the rest of the cast. (1/10)


As far as plot is concerned (or the lack there of), there are far too many convenient scapegoat moments (like, 10 years ago they said this thing that one time) to justify high stakes decisions that just seem frankly out of place and unsatisfying as any means of justification for actions.  It takes us 5 or 6 episodes to see any characters we recognize, all while we are struggling to determine the significance of the ones laid out before us.  So much information is kept from the viewer in an estranged effort to maintain some thin veil of mystery that the plot is a confusing mess.  The main plotline is weak, full of holes, and doesn't make a glimmer of sense to the viewer until it doesn't matter any more.  Actions and decisions made by (thought to be minor) characters and main ones alike are unjustified for their amount of impact.  More explaination without convenient scapegoating is needed badly. (1/10)


As a completionist I endure the pain of watching this season each week hoping that maybe it will turn itself into something half baked, but every week I am disappointed and left with more questions than the show has answers.  Enjoyment (1/10)


Sound isn't the worst thing, but its also quite lackluster, as well as some scenes where the music is completely asynchronous to the visuals at hand.  Might be rating this lower than it should be due to it's connection with everything else bad and unenjoyable but whatever.   (3/10)


Overall, don't waste your time.  Pretend the series ended after 2 seasons and don't get caught up in the hype train.  (2/10)",2021-03-24T08:36:00+00:00,2
"(I apologize in advance for my poor English)This season of AOT was really overhyped by the fandom and any criticism of it just means that people say you are too dumb to understand it OR ""you should be grateful for what you have got "".Animation - Hands down the worst it has been in the 4 seasons of AOT. Very choppy animation at some places (for example the forest fight), along with hideous CGI for ALL  the titan shifters this time, the camera angles and the editing all feels so amateur and like it is done with no passion at all. Still frames formost of the dialogue scenes with that boring brown filter ... I thought we were done with that. If you look at the various shots and camera angles that WIT gave us, along with the audiovisuals they were absolutely stunning, but MAPPA  is just a step-down. And it's not that they can't do it, just look at the CGI of dorohedoro and the animation of jujutsu kaizen. The war hammer titan fight was an absolute joke, I was laughing my ass off during the fight. They hyped us up with the trailer only to completely under deliver. I will definitely not be trusting the trailer of S4 part 2.


Soundtrack- Soundtracks have always been one of the strongest areas of AOT, but this season the same soundtrack that was revealed in the S4 trailer is SPAMMED FOR EVERY SINGLE ACTION SCENE (maybe with a few small changes ). It feels really weird and lazy. Not only did MAPPA come up with no new tracks for this season but they don't even use the full arsenal available from previous seasons. K21 during the forest fight and the piano soundtrack before the war declaration were the only fitting soundtrack moments this season. Kohta Yamamoto and Hiroyuki Sawanos partnership obviously didn't work out this time.

Character- In this season we are introduced to many new characters who are basically like mirror images of the ones we knew from Seasons 1 to 3.Gabi especially is supposed to be like a younger Eren hotheaded, brainwashed and ANNOYING. I understand the intention from Isayama but it all feels very heavy-handed and not subtle at all. Characters are now just info-dumping machines and have a grim face 24/7 (Eren I am talking about you ). Zeke is supposed to be the smartest character in the AOT universe but the number of times he has gotten his ass handed to him by an amathophobic Beyblade (ya I think Levi is really an average character) now is ridiculous. The author has obviously dumbed down a LOT of the characters for certain others to take the spotlight. Mikasa has to be one of the worst female characters I have ever seen. She is like a pokemon whose only cry is ""Ereh"". After 3 seasons I still know nothing about her character. Historia is now just sidelined and her only job left in the story is to give birth. Annie is irrelevant, still in that crystal just waiting for the final battle so she can make a comeback. Reiner is the only redeeming character in this mess, his development and perspective that we get to see from both sides are brilliant although the plot armour Isayama has given him is pretty ridiculous. All in all the bland new characters we are introduced to along with a drastic change of the ones we already knew without really seeing much of it doesn't make me very happy.



Story- I never really like the barebones politics in AOT. The story just feels like a mash of Norse mythology, Nazi-Jew racism, code geass(you'll know what I mean), Gender Blue etc. The world-building is so shallow. 3/4 seasons we spend on an island that we are made to believe is the only part of the world with life and after the basement reveal everything changes so drastically that I am sure anime-only watchers must have found it jarring. TBH I don't even care about the rest of this ""world"".  Isayama must have a good story in his mind but the way that it is told in this convoluted mess is not fun to watch at all. The flashbacks have also increased tenfold in this season. The biggest problem I have with AOT is the concept of PATHS. Every single asspull is conveniently explained away using PATHS. This gets worse and worse as the story progresses. Eren is the GOD of this world now with the attack titan, war hammer titan and founding titan and there is absolutely no sense of danger at all. The only way he can be beaten is if he does something stupid himself since he already knows how everything is going to end. I just want to ask Isayama - how many more times will we see Eren vs  Reiner, with Eren beating his ass and then Reiner being saved by plot armour ??  But one thing I have to give Isayama credit for is the foreshadowing .

Enjoyment / Overall - Considering all the other mediocre anime this season, I thought AOT would be a ray of hope but the obvious step down in animation and soundtrack, along with the completely different cast of bland characters, info-dumping and flashbacks galore - it felt like i was reading a boring history book and finished it just for the sake of it. This anime doesn't deserve to be #1 on MAL. Season 3 part 2 was better in almost every single aspect - animation, soundtrack, character moments, dialogue, story etc",2021-03-29T00:58:00+00:00,5
"Story: 6/10The story in AOT had been pretty mediocre since the commencement. It had commenced making sense in Season 3 however with the backstories and all of what had transpired in the past looping back in and making sense, but S4 seems just all over the place introducing another country's perspective of sorts which just doesn't seem fitting at this point to do. Not to forget that the world building is as shallow as can be, with the entirety of the world building revolving around only two countries while many a times the characters mention ""the world will visually perceive your acts"" or things likethat bringing in discombobulation as to ""who do they designate by the world?"" because they have never authentically shown any world beyond this.

Art: 6/10
The art in Season 1, 2 and 3 was pretty good, if not the best I have visually perceived in anime in general. The art in this season is like slideshows. They animated Mikasa like a guy and Armin like a girl. They animated the Survey Corps assailing a titan like flies circumventing on the screen, without any laws of physics on it, it's like a single pic that was kinetically circumventing as if in an Adobe FlashPlayer animation. They didn't even animate a whole titan because they didn't optate to draw 13 frames.

Sound: 5/10
The overall sound of the anime is genuinely deplorable, when it comes to the character voicelines. Armin was voiced by a female seiyuu pellucidly, doesn't match with his past voices. Much of the sound design of the anime overall is not good, I have given an adscititious point however for the ED which I authentically love.

Character: 6/10
This has been consistent for me since the commencement, nothing has transmuted to it even now. The characters are still just as bland and destitute of character as they were afore, they have made changes to Eren but I don't visually perceive how that has transpired or what has made it transpire. Same with the other characters, they show a vicissitude having occurred but I don't optically discern where it emanates from.

Delectation: 6/10
It's still a struggle for me to visually examine the anime in its totality. I had dropped the first season way early when it was still airing, but now that I have somehow managed to pull myself up and visually examine the series in its totality, I cerebrated I will leave a review here on the 4th season. When it comes to delectation, the fourth season is going very gradual and is not relishable. There are conspicuous pacing issues, the animation is pulling it back majorly, and the sound design being so mediocre additionally pulls it back. The consistent bantering about ""the world"" not aligning with what they have shown us till date withal brings the delectation down considerably because we just cannot relate to who they denote by the world.

Overall: 6/10
Still as deplorable as I recollect",2021-03-28T09:42:00+00:00,6
"I mean it's whatever. Some of the episodes just feel like filler. Adding a load of new stale characters to your already stale cast was a bad move. Falco is hella boring and reminds me of a typical anime of the season protagonist and he likes Gabi for literally no reason. Gabi, though kinda one note has at least something going for her. Eren bores the hell out of me. He starts talking poetic nonsense as if his ideas are extremely complex and philosophical when they're really just straight forward ""Everyone bad. Kill"". The choreography is really bad. AOT fans get mad when people startcriticizing the animation, but this is an action show that has amazing fight scenes under its belt. Yes I'm going to complain about the animation. The cgi is integrated well but it sometimes looks goofy, it's going to age really badly. *Spoilers* Sasha dies and everyone makes a big deal about it. She was barely developed. I like her but it's not like we lost anything important. Can't you guys see Isayama just remembered ""oh yeah I gotta kill another undeveloped squad memeber so everyone thinks my show is brutal to it's characters"" and then allows his more favorited cast to have infinite plot armor. Reiner is the best thing in the show. Zeke has potential but they're not doing anything with him. Eren's overrated. 

(Also random side note, do you guys seriously think this is going to beat FMAB? Im not a fan or anything but you do realize scores, especially with popular anime significant drop over time *stares at kimi no wa* Don't be surprised when it's underneath Gintama in a year).

Anyways

Story: 4/10:   
I'm sort of sick of the whole ""muh grey area, all sides are bad"" thing for the billionth time with nothing to it.

Art: 5/10:   
Bad survey corps fight scenes, passable titan fight scenes, casual animation is okay (I think I've been spoiled by wonder eggs priority animation).

Sound: 6/10
yeah whatever, nothing amazing.

Characters: 4/10 
Stop adding new characters and giving them air time.

Enjoyment: 3/10
I liked the other seasons more even though I wasn't the biggest fan.

OVERALL: 4/10 

Everything that happened between Season 3 and Season 4 needs to get sorted out, give me another flashback or something because it's really confusing.",2021-02-01T16:42:00+00:00,4
"""I just keep moving forward, Until I destroy my enemies""Attack on TItan season 4 will be banger as the start of the 2021 this the climaxMAPPA studio did a great job in animating the first 5 episode their art style makes aot a whole new anime and i like that feeling and i dont understand how people are hating on mappa because what? they used the wrong ost for that moment in my opinion it would've been great to use the other osts instead of milking the war theme.Every episode makes me hype and the internet goes crazy everytime new episode comes out this isgonna go down as a masterpiece this  is a pretty top-tier anime and I expect a full adaptation and i would like to thank mappa studio for making this possible without them aot wouldnt probably airing right now.

Here's my rating on the characters so far
Eren yeager (10/10) loved his character development in the last seasons he feels like a new person now that the tables have turned

Reiner Braun (10/10) Now that we get to see his perspectivewe understand him alot what he had to go through the suffering in marley to paradis island
like as eren said ""I'm the same as you""

Gabi Braun (8/10) new character appearance in the anime she reminds me of eren season 1 of how determined and how dedicated she is to become a warrior for marley like how eren was determined to defeat every last titan back then and we will be expecting character development on her


Falco Grice (9/10) as we heard in the previous episode he is also aspiring to be a great warrior like gabi to protect her and that enough gets my respect

That's all I can say for the characters the other characters i couldnt think of any words to express to them since they dont appear that much but that is my ratings on snk season 4 and once again
THANK YOU MAPPA!! WE HOPE FOR GOOD WORK AND GOOD HEALTH TO THE STAFF

"This was not how I expected the story would turn out. I only immersed myself in this franchise for the enjoyment of watching young soldiers take on deadly giants in a high-speed, aerial battle while trying to uncover the secret of these so-called titans. Now warning for those who haven't read the manga, because this is where I will start to point out my own problems with the franchise and it will contain a fair amount of spoilers especially from the manga for you anime only viewers, so you have been warned.THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSi didn't like the direction the story was heading towards eversince the founder titan's backstory and its powers were introduced. it was awfully simple, bland, and very convenient for the sake of the plot. memory alteration, titan control, and such are just wow. i can't say i'm impressed.

the secret to the basement was just disappointing on so many levels, i mean c'mon! a door anyone can knock down (good job levi my boy) and the key that we spent years waiting to know was a freaking desk drawer key??????

and oh my god the plot of humans existing beyond the walls and sea was just stupid! that was the reason why they started the war arc, or worst arc. i did not watch this series because i wanted a war drama genre! i wanted giant slaying and spider-man slinging action. pure and simple, but effective. japanese manga tend to always start going off track when it comes to the conclusion of their own series.

speaking of conclusions, seriously? the final arc of eren going full out edge lord yuji sakai was just downright infuriating and dumb. what did they do to you eren?!! that wasn't character development, that was the mangaka running out of ideas and still wanting to somehow end the series with an impact using the main protagonist, they just went ""well, i might as well give eren some kind of importance so i'll turn him into shu ouma and make him the final boss.""

i wish they could've done something more with reiner and especially annie. like seriously, annie, you were sealed the whole time and when you get out, you blush a few times for armin and that""s pretty much it. i really expected a lot more from what could happen with annie when she is released.

as for the aesthetics and sound production, i can't say i like the new art style very much. i was already disappointed with the character development but the drawing style just made me care less and less about them too. mikasa looks like a man, more specifically season 2 one punch man's sonic. and the opening song sounds like something that would work for tanya the evil, which i know yea the last arc is a war arc hence the song but come onnnnnn. i don't listen to that song and immediately think ""oh yeah this is definitely attack on titan, it rockss"".

and my biggest gripe of them all (which i'm biased for), potato girlllll, my best girl!!!!!! nooooooo!!! god i hate gabi!!! you can literally take gabi out of the story and nothing would have changed one bit, i couldn't have cared less for the two kids!! i always hate it when they have to introduce new characters (asides from the antagonists who usually receive a last reveal) in the last arc of anime.


So for the TLDR: AoT Season 1 is best season. Season 2 is also great as it continuously invigorates my curiosity to just what are the titans. Season 3 Part 1 had some great points like delving into the political side of AoT and it was interesting to see, but really couldn't have cared less for the Founding Titan, Historia, and ruler stuff (Levi and Kenny's relationship was interesting tho). Season 3 Part 2 had many ups and downs. Who didn't enjoy the climatic showdown between the Survey Corps and the remaining titans?! But at the same time, the secret to basement was a letdown, Eren's slightly subtle grimacing with his dad's memories, and the reaction to the ocean was a huge downer for me. And Season 4, or Final Season (which isn't actually final) is well, you should already know. I hate everything about it.

What started off as a great 16th century-esque setting with Spider-Man slinging slashers fighting man-eating giants to uncover the truth ended as a half World War II battleground half Armagedon  spirit realm fanfic to conveniently tie up every loose end they couldn't explain in a logical and reasonable fashion. Looking at the other reviews written here and the series' current ranking as of this writing, I am shocked that this was rated so high. Everyone mostly said that this was a masterpiece of storytelling, and no I just can't agree. FMAB or HxH were masterful and loyal to their original themes and worldbuilding that was set up from the start. AoT started strong and slowly drifted off-course as time went on and concluded as a half-baked product in the end. If you disagree with me, share your argument down below and convince me that I'm completely wrong and off the mark. No cursing. If you agree, share your opinions as well. Thank you for reading until the end.",2021-03-29T00:09:00+00:00,1
"Just an outstanding anime I would recommend it to anyone new to animeEverything about it is amazing. People call it overrated but it just deserves everything it has now. I will admit the main character isn't likeable at the beginning but as it progresses, I start to understand him more and more. The whole journey was fun. Eren is one of the best, if not the best written character. Levi, Erwin, Armin, Reiner, etc are so well written too.Thanks, Isayama.Story: 10/10Art:10/10Sound: 10/10Character: 10/10Enjoyment: 10/10Overall: 10/10One of the best anime out there.",2021-03-21T23:21:00+00:00,10
"I have to give this a 10, I mean after all we're talking about Attack on Titan. A  show that when released back in 2013 instantaneously became a huge hit. We as fans waited 4 years to get Season two, which debuted in 2017. However, this wait was worth it. 7-8 Years later, after the initial release of the first Season we get a great studio with stunning visuals and a cinematic masterpiece. (FIRST REVIEW BTW SO DONT GIVE HATE)~I will try to write the rest of the review without spoiling anything~Story (10/10): As for the story, fans of Hajime Isayama can always expectsomething great. Attack on Titan started off as something ""cool"", and appealed to fans of ""action"". However, nobody could've expected this turnout. Within the past few seasons, we the audience have witnessed a cinematic masterpiece unfold before our eyes. This story, is quite simply just one of the all-time best. The intertwinement between each and every single thing that goes on, the studios that have picked up to animate such a beautiful piece of art, they've all done a great job with animating such a beautiful series.

Art (10/10): Studio Mappa, slept on and recently getting harassed over this Final Season doesn't deserve the hate they get. The art itself is outstanding, they've literally animated the characters very similarly to how they appear in the Manga. The CG (although looked down upon by many people) is outstanding. There is no better studio that could have been used in order to animate this final season.

Sound (10/10): Don't get me started on the Sound Design, it's absolutely AMAZING. Everything sound so natural, and the OST, and just the whole soundtrack is beautiful. The overall quality of the sound design is superb. They delicately chose some of the best songs, along with people to work on the sound design.  

Character (10/10): There's really not much to say about the characters, as they're all beautiful in design. The character development, the art of these characters, are just so surreal. Each and every single character plays a part in this, and we understand each and every single one. Especially the ones that we've known since Season 1, since the beginning. We truly understand these characters as a whole, and they're so beautifully made. 

Enjoyment (10/10): Attack on Titan is easily one of the best anime to watch if you're looking to enjoy a show. There are ups, there are downs. There are hype moments, and even moments that'll lead you to a depressive state. If you've watched the prior seasons of Attack on Titan, you're surely to enjoy this season. However, a lot more things are going to happen. 

Overall (10/10): Well, if you're some baka who doesn't want to watch a cinematic masterpiece then you're just missing out. Attack on Titan is a goated show, and always will be. If you're up for something that will keep you on your feet, and give you one of the best story lines in cinematic history, Attack on Titan is a great choice. Overall, this show is beautifully directed, beautifully choreographed and all around a masterpiece.",2021-01-31T14:37:00+00:00,10
"Disclaimer: I'll rant a bit about the low IQed people who rate this anime 1 star out of despise and then I'll write my review, Scroll down to see the review directly.I have been through most of the reviews and I am yet to see a legitment 1 star review.But  I have discovered something, There are 2 people in the review section, First is the people who despise the anime for becoming Top 2 and rating it 1 star without even knowing what the show's about, the 2nd type of people who are literally the stupidest human beings I have ever met, they're eitherstupid or purposely trying to mislead people to not watch it, I even saw one comment saying  ""bruh this anime is so overrated the story is only about titans eating humans wtf"" Like.. Did you even make it past the 1st EPISODE? I have seen another review saying armin is too flat to be a girl....????????? Armin isn't a girl how low is your IQ? honestly, with an anime this big tho, there bound to be dumb people watching it and I'm not judging but if you have a low IQ don't judge the anime just because you couldn't understand what was happening, go fix your attention span first.


Now about  my review, This anime is a masterpiece in every way possible, the OSTS are literally thee best I've ever heard in ANY anime to date, the complexity of the story is outstanding and amazing, EVERY LITTLE DETAIL has a meaning, Nothing is filler, Nothing is fan service, EVERYTHING has a meaning and a purpose, For example, Eren's dream at the start of episode 1 of season 1 Literally teased the death of THREE of the MAIN CHARACTERS, but we were too naive to notice the frames,

Character development is on another level with this anime, You will literally see a main character go through so many phases of life that he turns from the protagonist of the story into the antagonist and an antagonist turn into a protagonist, No side character is ignored everyone has their own story to the point it'll be very hard who you should side with, imagine a story that makes you literally want to side with the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" just because you saw the world from everyone's prospective, prospective really does change the world. The pacing is amazing aswell 
 and finally the art style is unique, what studio wit did in season 1-3 was so unique no anime could come close to it the anime had its own atmosphere and diversed from the cleche anime atmosphere

Overall an anime like this comes once a century Make sure to watch it and avoid spoilers because it'll ruin the experience for you.",2021-01-29T05:12:00+00:00,10
"As a manga reader, I already know this is gonna be a masterpiece. Iseyamas writing for Eren is genius and might even come close or equal to Beserk or Vinland sagas character writing. Erens development over the 3 seasons perfectly symbolizes the process and power of aging and learning. Most people give up because of the trauma but Eren chooses to move forward but Iseyama has twisted Eren's defining trait, ""fight on no matter what"" into the morally grey by what season 4 will cover. He even brings back the words Eren shouted during the climax of the first 12 episodes of season 1 ""Fight,Fight, Fight..."". The shift of viewpoint at the end of season 3 part 2 in Eren's motivation was an example of masterpiece level writing. No longer did he have a mother to avenge, a home to come back to, or a brainless, or evil, ""monster"" to hate. Instead, his real enemy was the worst kind... other humans. And during this season we will see how maturing in the cruel world he grew up in has turned him into a ""monster"".  Attack on titan always has and always will be a monster story, but now the monster is Eren himself. As for the animation so far, MAPPA has done wonders with Erens titan transformation during ep 5. Most people couldn't even tell it was CGI. The sound design was top tier as always and the utilization of music during its scenes is amazing. The new op and ed have some very impressive animation and symbolism in them and suit the series quite nicely. Every manga reader screams when they watch the ed for the first time especially :). Overall I cannot give a complete breakdown on the deeper meanings of the story and truly criticize it yet due to the series not being done yet, but I think Ive written enough. ps historia is best worst girl",2021-01-12T22:09:00+00:00,10
"Ight bro I'm not saying this season is bad, its just that thus season pales in comparison to the other seasons. I was never to big of a fan of AOT in the first place(I think  the show is good I rated the other season an 8). This season is worse. in everyway, the animation, story, animation, art, its all a step down. People be giving this shit a 10 an it isn't even close to a 10. Those people fucking tripping' n shit. But in all this season is straight ass, fucking boring, doesn't even compare to great anime's like SAO.",2021-04-07T16:44:00+00:00,6
"I finally got round to catching up to this anime after the part finished, and let me say it was disappointing.the characters are  mediocre at best but i cant get emotionally attached to a women who hasn't done anything since season 2 (Sasha)Gabi on the other hand is the most well written character in S4 and you can care for a 12 year old girl only doing what she was told do, also all her friends DIE in front of her and grown ass men want to beat her up think of someone else's point of view for once in there lives I wasreally hoping the levi would die in that explosion with that stupid fucking monkey, he only in the series to show the ""TrAgIc FiGhTiNg BaCkStOrY"" to the audience his fighting style is to become a Beyblade

Reiner has more plot amour than goku on steroids, he should of died like 8 times he is so trash he has amour then get it punched off of him immediately it is literally cardboard   

man-kasa the worst tom boy of the 21st century she isn't even hot she simps over eren like 40 yr old hogs that watch this show simp over v-tubers

eren is the single most annoying person in this dumpster fire of a show he is so replaceable it isn't even funny there nothing special about his goofy ass

the fandom is even worse than the show. there isn't even a point to be so angry that a good studio had to animate this trash show i'm surprised they even  decided to animate this god awful show, how dose it feel that  you get angry at hard working people drawing day after day to then serve you beautifully presented shit on a plate 

 overall a 3/10 the fandom, the plot, the characters and every thing else is just so bad. this is overrated  as all fuck",2021-03-31T09:53:00+00:00,3
"MAJOR SPOILERS AHEADAoT went from one of my alltime favorite animes to insultingly dreadful trash in a single (half) season.(Insert mandatory 'art looks like butt/Mikasa looks like a dude' here)First off, we get unceremoniously thrown years into the future to watch a conflict that doesn't matter with characters we don't care about.Next, the characters' personalities almost all radically change with no explanation whatsoever. Especially jarring is Eren, who has gone from a passionate and fiercely loyal standard ""hero-protag"" type, to a manbun-wearing nihilistic edgelord who carelessly endangers his comrades/friends, doesn't give a half-shit when they die, even when it's his fault, and treats his lifelongfriends like absolute garbage.

Everyone acts like Zeke is some great character, but he's just an equally nihilistic edgelord who wants to genocide his own people because his parents expected too much from him.

Gabi is a brainwashed capital B-itch who hates her own kind because other people who hate her own kind tell her to. She's downright GIDDY to join in on a completely unprovoked mass genocide, and then is actually shocked that the people she wants to kill for no actual good reason do a pre-emptive strike. Continues to hate her own kind and learn literally nothing even after seeing how they are actually decent people. The anime is REALLY expecting us to like her for some reason.

For MOST of the season, everyone you expect would be DOING something is sitting on their hands for no real specified reason. Even Armin who throughout all previous seasons is hyped as a tactical genius, sits around, barely even ATTEMPTING to think his way out of the mess Eren created.
Hot-headed Mikasa, who in any other season would have gone to Eren's side to figure out wtf is going on, passively obeys orders for once in her life and just doesn't do anything.

Eren and Zeke's ""master plan"" to ""save the world"" is to genocide their own kind through mass sterilization. Not only is it jarring how quickly Eren jumps on board with this plan without a single inkling of moral struggle, when this plan is finally revealed to his ex-comrades, not only does NO ONE breath a word of objection to point out that this is evil, ask what gives them tge right to decide this for an entire race of people, or attempt to suggest alternatives.... Armin actually WEEPS at how NOBLE he thinks the goal of destroying his own people this way is. Literally.

It was already revealed that the story told about the Eldian's 'sins' are false, Marley is CLEARLY a deeply authoritarian power-hungry state bent on world domination who commits atrocities without batting an eye and wants to kill the Eldians just to remain an unrivaled superpower.....yet EVERYONE from the horribly oppressed Eldians in Marley to the Paradis Eldians whose troubles ENTIRELY stem from Marley's ruthless power-grabbing, to our ""heroes"", all unanimously agree that Eldians suck and need to stop existing and Marley needs to win...yet they're still fighting with eachother despite their goals being EXACTLY THE SAME, just with different ways they want to go about it.",2021-03-29T00:11:00+00:00,3
"Attack on Titan will be probably go down in history as an anime “classic”. As much as some will dislike the show and this Season in particular there is no denying it. At this point it surpassed Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood as the highest rated show on this website (yikes this didn't age well), maybe partially because of the euphoria and hype for the next Season, but even with that taken into consideration it's a show loved by so many people. And while I enjoy the show I would not claim it to be ""peak fiction"" or even an extraordinary show.There are some spoilers inthis review, you have been warned. 

This Season is a great shift in every sense of the word. At first, we don't even follow the main cast we knew up to that point, then this season is more dialogue heavy than the previous ones and characters take turns that many did not expect. When looking at how much changed this Season and will in the next one I think its remarkable how little Mikasa and Armin changed, who both are or at least were part of the main cast of this show. 
Mikasa still being one of the characters I dislike the most. Her whole character arc revolves around Eren, given that she is an Ackerman that also somewhat makes sense in the series, however that does not make it a good character arc. Its also not even given that much attention, we see a glimpse of what might go on with her, but that's it. Her connection to Hizuru is mentioned but not really plays any role in the story or with her character. 
Armin's only character trait at this point is that he ate Berthold and his connection to Anni, who still is frozen in that crystal. Everything that happened before this season is either forgotten or already taken as a ""finished"" character arc. 

With those two characters that stayed more or less the same i will now go into the real meat of this Season. Starting with the new characters and the world building of this season as a whole.  
We have 16 episodes that try to grasp a world that is multiple times bigger than what we knew up to that point. Given how many manga chapters are left to adapt there also is not much more after this season that could be done. I won't go into great detail on the worldbuilding, but I think it more or less does the ""bare minimum"" to not be considered bad or boring/generic. The concept introduced with the relationship between Eldia and Marley is interesting, its also conveyed somewhat believable. Aside from that however the world feels shallow. The war between Marley and the Mid-East Allied Forces exists I guess, Hizuru that seems to be influenced by Japanese History also exists. And aside from its relationship to Eldia and their hate for them, we also know barely anything about Marley. Instead of crafting an amazing world with great detail and rich cultures Isayama uses the world as a tool for his themes.

The new characters introduced with Marley are all not bad, but also far from revolutionary.

Gabi is very stereotypical, which is not bad (as we will see with Eren later on) and can get turned into something interesting. But Gabi until the very end of this season pretty much has a predictable arc. She was brainwashed and now slowly learns that not all Eldians are monsters. Also, only changing because she now knows what her hateful actions do to people (killing Sasha) seems like an easy way out, slowly developing her into noticing something is wrong with her ideology without using the death of Sasha would be far more interesting in my opinion. How its resolved now feels believable and is also not bad. 

Falco is basically her counterpart, not being completely brainwashed but still being the victim in the end. I dont really have a strong opinion on him, i guess he is a fine character but due to a lack of development nothing special. The other new characters all are similar. 

Reiner is by far the in my opinion well realized character in the entire series, from all the characters with internal conflicts his gets attention to the point his character feels pretty well-rounded. His character arc is not perfect by any means and also feels a little short at some point. However, the first four episodes and all the things we know up to now make for an understandable character. He almost feels like the embodiment of the central conflict of the show, knowing the good and bad of both sides and being conflicted. 

Eren is what many claim to be the best character this season. And while i agree that what happened is interesting, i would not say its due to him now being a fleshed and less shounen like protagonist. His change is very in your face, he now has longer hair and is much more reserved. What makes all of what happened to his character a little underwhelming, is that we never really saw all those changes happen. We can suspect the reasons and theorize about them, not much more. What makes a great character in my opinion, is actually SEEING a change over the course of multiple episodes and seasons, slowly getting to know reasons for change. We saw more about Reiners reasons for change then we saw about Erens, even Reiners are not what, at least for me, would make a well fleshed out character but still more than Eren. 

When it comes to the Audiovisuals this Season is below Attack on Titan standards, but still pretty well-made overall. The more moody color pallet and lighting might fit the overall feeling of the current season but compared to what we had before this season it, to me, feels inferior. Its just not as crisp. The CGI Titans are not much worse than the ones we had in the second part of Season three, they just appear more often. 

The OST is not as enthralling as it was the last seasons, which makes sense given the change in tone, but still is pretty disappointing. The voice acting in general is superb, especially the ones of the old cast are really living their role. 


Attack on Titan started pretty battle shounen like and in this season tries to move forward, beyond those classic character tropes and unremarkable themes. That alone is remarkable. It does not follow the classic Shounen story and more or less subverts our expectations that were set with the first season. I genuinely hope there are Manga artists getting inspired by Attack on Titan that will produce Shounen with a similar level of ambition in the Future, I would take something like this over the next My hero academia any day. 

The biggest problems with this Season is the pacing or how this entire conflict was handled. The show introduces a big unknown world, tries to deliver intriguing politics and a very morally ambiguous story with even more characters. In the end however every single one of those aspects gets insufficient attention throughout this Season. The whole conflict between Eldia and Marley gets explained through a history lesson, every other reason and aspect to that conflict that may be there either is not mentioned or not noteworthy. Character change, as with Eren for example, get explained very vaguely and without much backstory. Trying many things, but not actually going in depth in any of them is the reason for this season being not as good as it could've been for me. 

Don't get me wrong I still enjoyed this season. It's still like a fast-paced action movie, that now also tries to be a political drama without taking the time to make said drama believable and engaging. This political drama seems more like a tool to use when its necessary to progress with the story, it's not about the politics or about the world. What it truly is about we will see in the final final season when its core themes will hopefully get a satisfying conclusion that makes all this lackluster worldbuilding, character development and political drama worth it, and even if it's not worth for the themes at least we will still see bombastic fights (I mean that ending cliffhanger was nasty :). Attack on Titan could have been better, with at least 2 or 3 Seasons more on top of those 2 final ones. Its one of the few Shounen where more episodes could've really made a difference for the positive in my eyes.  

*sigh* that was a lot of criticism. 

I, for one, will watch the last Season and hope MAPPA take the time they need to make it the best Season it can be animation wise. Firstly because then at least the fans leave this series satisfied and secondly the series as a whole will not be remembered for the oh so mediocre animation in its last entry.",2021-03-28T14:44:00+00:00,6
"I love attack on titan, the first seasons were beyond amazing, but now i totally lost interest on the new season and i will explain why: i just lost interest like i can´t tell if the pacing is too fast or too slow, they gave a bunch of information in a single episode and the worse is that they use too much formal dialogue wich sometimes its hard to understand, like in season 3 « didn´t know that eren saw the future, i only knew because of social media wich is because the anime always rushed the informations  but then later they explained butthats because of shock value, they want you too keep watching so they leave you on a cliffhanger or gave you extremely rushed information, attack on titan could easily end in 2 seasons if they didn´t use shock value. 
also the ""foreshadowing"" isn´t really foreshadowing its just that the author throwns a bunch of things and later he tries to realize what he can do with that,thats why sometimes it can be very messy like season 3 part 1 was just terrible they just throw a bunch of information in the most rushed way possible . also how he sometimes adds a lil magic like, reiner should have died at lateast 3 times but oh boy the amount of plot armour he has, isayama even added a  random magic so he can save the little boy, poor bertolhd all the plot armour goes to his friend.


STORY: 6/10 Characters: 4/10
nothing really happened this season that much and yeah i know this is only the first half of season 1 but c ´mon, like in 16 eps i wouldn´t say its filler but i feel like its going too slow, like the mikasa family or whatever that arc is, is extremely boring and uninteristing, first i was never interested in mikasa she is bland, uninsteristing, and dull for me, ye she is strong and all but still her personality is B L A N D but now levi he is also super strong but at lateast he has a personality and isn´t dull, yeah he is edgy but at lateast he has a personality.
Eren is one of the most bland main characters to exist, "" Oh but he is a antagonist, he isn´t even bad or good"" NO,  being a antagonist doesn´t mean good, he totally bland he doesn´t even has a personality, i mean he never had but now its worse he is more edgy now and B L A N D, if i would do a top 10 aot characters he deffo wouldn´t be there, just because he holds  a big role doesn´t mean he is the best anime characters of all the time, because he is bland, far away from being relatable, all of his motivations were thrown way, i can´t understand his character or nothing because he barely appeared in this season, and when he appears he just throwns a whole edgy conversation and messy, till this day i still don´t know why he ""keeps moving foward till all his enemies are destroyed"" it was never explained, like why?!? why he thinks like thats, i can´t understand a shit about his character, its just messy and rushed, most of people who hype him is the new gens or the girls in tiktok who simp for him, myself as a veteran anime watcher, eren ain´t even top 300 characters in all anime, Grisha is the real main characters in AOT, he was the one who did all the dirty stuff, he suffered but then he still lost but at the same time he won, he was the one did all the food , what eren is doing is just finishing eating that food. Eren is just a selfish edgy teen whose actions are unexplained.
as for the characters are dull for me, armin has a personality and development but its far away from being realistic, i mean none of the characters in AOT are relatable for me expect for bertolhd.
also i heard this season is going to leave on a cliffhanger so pratticaly nothing much happened in this season besides the long uninteristing dialogue.

5/10 animation is terrible, the art atmostphere everything seems generic, AOT doesnt have anymore that pleasing ART with that powerful colours, now they just dull, the cgg donne good but it doesn´t fix  on AOT, AOT was so good with that animation now its terrible .

 7/10 the soundtrack, it aint bad but nothing memorable, the ending is okay , opening is okay too",2021-03-05T04:54:00+00:00,6
"Honestly as a person who watched all AOT right before the new season came out I must say AOT is all hype and not a masterpiece. But do not mistaken this as me saying this anime is bad because it's not. The show to me is just average. Story 6/10:(spoilers for people who havent seen past seasons)We are left off with the people of Paradis Island discovering that another country has been attacking them all this time and Eren wants revenge. Interesting idea awful execution. The idea makes sense but there is flashback episodes before things that happened before the first episode of the seasonin later episodes of this season. The show goes all over the place and just makes the episodes feel out of order. There is alot of narritive dumping that just make the plot slow and boring at times. I do think the story it self is good but the way it was executed could have been so much better.

Art 5/10:
Noticeable dip in quality fight scenes aren't as clean character design isn't as polished needs to be way better

Sound 6/10:
Nothing much to say about it except unmemorable.

Character 5/10:
Every character in the main cast besides Eren are about the same just older Eren is completely different now but there isn't enough to know what triggered this drastic change in character.They add so many new characters this season and a majority of them are unlikable or bland. The shows tries hard for you to understand Gabi but it fails every time. Falco seems. interesting but there isn't enough development to know about him. All the other characters have interesting aspects but they don't have enough time to be developed. Leaves a lot to be desired.

Enjoyment 5/10:
Could be way better if it was executed better. I don't think its bad but I wouldn't say this is something that is amazing or a must watch I think its quite mediocre if not somewhat disappointing. I like some of the fights and some plot points about politics are interesting but besides this nothing special.

Overall 5/10",2021-02-28T18:37:00+00:00,5
"The story of Attack on Titan has always been amazing since the beggining and looks like will continue to be impressively well made and interesting with a good pacing too.The art/animation in this season already is one of the best seen to date, MAPPA tried to keep Wit Studio's original style while also staying loyal to the manga style, the use of CGI is near perfect and doesn't has any major issues worth of ruining the experience, and the special effects are also on point.Opening is amazingly creative, taking a diferent turn compared to what the previous opening were like, the vibes it gives arefitting to the whole atmosphere of this final season, and the ending is also beautiful.

The sound design is really impressive, I never managed to get so immersed into a scenario the way the first episode got me to be, it's satisfying, sharp or rough when needed, everything is very well made, voice acting is also amazing, keeping the original cast was truly the right choice, new voice actors also are doing a great job.

The characters were pretty well presented, and were likeable from the start, you already have a understading of their objectives and personalities seen by little moments and dialogues throughout the episodes.

Pretty enjoyable so far, the episodes pass by in 5 minutes, I couldn't take my eyes out the screen and kept freaking out because of every moment and high quality everywhere I looked.

10/10 Absolutely outstanding, I hope this insane amount of quality is kept throughout the whole rest of the story, which is a lot to ask for, It's way too hard to have such a good show keep such quality until the end, but only time will tell.",2021-01-30T05:09:00+00:00,10
"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!A quick note about the more technical aspects of this season before I get into what really bothered me about this season. the music was phenomenal as always and I can't ignore that, even with the low rating I've given this show. the opening is fantastic and suits the drastic change in the direction of the series perfectly, even if I don’t like this new direction. On the animation…. Its fine most of the time but seems to fail when most important. For example, with the change in studio came the change in titan animation, which is now suddenly at leastpartially GC. The blending isn’t too bad and there are obviously worse offenders out there, but it is pretty off putting and I couldn't help but be disappointed. The second example I have for the animation's deterioration is the entirety of episode two.   which for some reason seemed to be partially constructed of a mix of ""normal"" and what seems to be Rotoscope animation? The movement of the characters felt very awkward and did not suit the occasion. It was off putting and bothered me to no end watching that episode. Over all the show doesn’t really look bad.  The rendering is great like it was in previous seasons. 
And now to my nitty gritty review/ short analysis. 
I honestly had hope.
I had spent the last few years of my life so invested in this series giving it all rewatch before this season, and I have never been so disappointed, almost betrayed. It impossible to watch this show without noticing the extremely un subtle comparisons to world war 2. We had a bit of it in season 3 but it didn’t bother me too much and I, as a Jewish person, thought I could still enjoy it and look past it.  I could look past the discrimination against the Eldians, they aren't THAT similar to Jews! Right? Oh how wrong I was.
Season 4 is basically the culmination of every single trigger a Jewish person can have. And yes I'm aware that there are gonna be some people reading this who will laugh at the use o the word ""trigger"" because it has been used so loosely to describe anything that could bother someone. But I'm using it seriously. 
The amount of similarities between how the Eldians are represented in the show to Jewish people and antisemetic notions it insane. Not only the star armband, it's their clothing, their lifestyle, they live in literal ghettos, the ones like my family grew up in. they are treated like devils for what their ancestors did. Speaking of their ancestors; in the show, the Marley (the Eldian oppressors) excuse their actions because ""the Eldians deserve it"". According to history of this world, the Eldians use to be tyrannical rulers, devils. if you can't tell where I'm going with this, let me educate you on some antisemitisim. There was and still is an antisemitic misconception/lie that Jews were greedy devils, that rule over the world from behind the scenes. Attack on titan is feeding into this lie fool force with its world's history that the people who are obviously supposed to mirror/ are based off Jewish people in world war 2, are devils. 
And just like that, the Marley are obviously supposed to be the ""Nazis"" I won't go too far into this comparison because there is obviously no need if you have even a basic understanding of world war 2 and the holocaust. Whether the shows history is true or fake (like it is in reality), the Marley oppress Eldians for what their ancestors have done, which is awful on every stance. They treat them like dirt, like as if for some internal, biological reason they are in the right in their oppressing. And then there's the obvious way they dress and style their hair which is literally just redrawing ww2.
If you think the comparison between the Eldians and Jewish people and the Marley to ""Nazis"" were where I was gonna stop with this review, you are sorely mistaken, because I have a lot more to say.
Episodes 5 and 6 made my blood boil. The show has done a lot to make a point that there are no good and bad guys. As viewers we would almost always gravite to the side we've been following from day ones, but it's obvious that if the show was written from the Marley's side from the beginning, you'd want to be on their side. Or at least that’s how they tried to write it. They tried to make both sides ""morally gray"" and of course no one side is evil nor good, but you cannot compare the two.
In episode 6 when the Eldians, the ""protagonists"" fight back against a hundred years of consecutive oppression, that they are suddenly wrong to do so, or that they compare by any means to the Marley. I could not find it in myself to feel bad for them. 
I think what irks me the most is honestly the blatant comparison to actual, real history that happened not even 80 years ago. I think I would have been able to watch to watch it just fine. 
My personal conclusion: 
It fine if you enjoy the show, I won't judge anyone who does, but acknowledge its extremely problematic side. I dropped it simply because it came increasingly hard on me to watch and decided to spill my opinions and review here.",2021-01-21T04:20:00+00:00,4
"What you have to understand about the final season is that it is divisive. Some say it's the best Attack on Titan has ever been with phenomenal art and animation, while others would disagree from the lack of traditional hand drawn titans to poor choice of music.Story - 10The arc is just perfect. This is the only arc willingly to take the time to explore the characters in depth, developing them and building up to a climax that pays off. Attack on Titan has grown from what it was in season 1 and the story reflects every bit of that.Art/Animation - 2It's not good. Iwas skeptical and hopeful when I saw that titans were CGI in episode 1. I thought they were saving resources for more important scenes later on. But, that simply isn't the case. Even humans are CGI now and honestly I don't have any hope left for the season. I understand that this is coming from absurd deadlines, but MAPPA did this to themselves. They willing agreed to animate knowing the schedule.

Sound - 7
I like the music, but it isn't on par to what season 1-3 have offered. It feels repetitive with most of the soundtrack being the one in the trailer, just remixed.

Character - 7
I'm giving this one a 7. This arc did develop existing characters, but even then, a lot of the main casts are under-developed and you kind of just forget about them all together. Maybe if Isayama is willing to develop more characters at the rate he kills them off, then we might like them more.

Overall - 6
Terrible CGI. Okay sound. Good story and character development, even if the latter feels more like a side dish than anything else.",2021-01-18T17:04:00+00:00,6
I just love The story of SNK and i think Mappa is a good studio.However i am convinced that Mappa didn't have enough time for the animation and particularly the CGI ( which don't look good from my point of view ). So far the the new look of the caracters ( particularly Eren ) is rather good and the soundtracks are the same as before which were amazing.The story is still the best part of SNK and if you haven't read the manga yet each episode blow your mind a little bit more by giving the infomations you are looking for since season 1It's a pity that the CGI leaves a bitter taste... Because overall the whole thing is great.,2021-01-17T12:49:00+00:00,9
"Welcome to the final season of Attack on Titan, except it isn't the final season there will be one final ""final season"" in 2022. So welcome to the panultimate season of Attack on Titan that they for some reason call the final season.A more fitting name might be ""The exposition season"" since that is mostly what happens in this one a lot of exposition, new characters and the background for said characters. In between the exposition there's titan drama and fight scenes which look great as the story slowly builds up to the cliffhanger to the final final season.Even though it is slow paced mostof the time, due to the new character introductions and the fact that there is a few years time jump from the last season to this one, I don't feel it ever gets right out boring. This is mostly due to the investment I allready have in the story, the beautiful art and well animated fight scenes. However as it trot along and it became clear that this in fact was NOT the final season the sens of it simply beeing required reading grew.

Attack on Titan is still a solid show and I believe the final final season can be a 10/10, but this season left me slightly disappointed.",2021-03-28T13:03:00+00:00,6
"I don't think I can add anything that hasn't been said, but I'd like to defend SnK against unwarranted hate and unfair criticisms. No, I am not an overhyping fan, but I have to admit that SNK is a masterpiece in the making.Firstly, the most helpful (actual) negative review on MAL criticized AoT for having bad characterization. Now, I admit that some of them are decent, not great, characters, like Sasha, Connie and Mikasa. However, given that Sasha and Connie are two supporting and not major characters, it is not that big of a deal. The only valid criticism is about Mikasa.This criticism is whollyunfair because it disregards other characters that are incredibly well-fleshed and complex, such as Reiner, Eren, Armin, and the whole bunch of antagonists. So if you count, the majority of recurring, major characters have great depth to them. There is no denial that the antagonists, if they might be called as such, are the one of, if not the most, complex villains ever seen in an anime. Other characters take a little bit longer to develop, such as Eren, but his belated development, in the grand scale of things, makes absolute sense. Eren became tunnel-visioned after experience a trauma, but after knowing the truth about the world, he underwent tremendous growth. Given that the show's major theme is the power of truth, Eren's lack of character development in the first two seasons is forgivable, and becomes a twist of sorts when we see an unrecognizable Eren in S4. 

The review also criticized Levi and Erwin as being one-dimensional, which is baseless. In S3, Erwin's character is fleshed out nicely. The viewers got to understand his motivation, his dream, his regrets, and his guilt upon seeing hundreds of his comrades die. He felt as if he was standing upon a mountain of bodies, and felt the need to repay them, and bring meaning to them. Meanwhile, Levi was put into a difficult situation of having to choose between Erwin and Armin, and his decision showed an irrational yet incredibly humane side to him. We also got to see Levi's past and his moral stance on killing people for survival. 

Second, the review attacks Historia for being ""weird,"" accusing her of flip-flopping between helping and hating on humanity. Historia, in declaring she is humanity's greatest enemy, decided that she would be selfish and choose to go against her father's wish, which could potentially force humanity to walk down an unknown road. She refused to be her father's tool in ""saving humanity."" But this by no means means that she actually hates humanity and wants everyone to die. 

Third, they hated the show for being ""ex-machina."" I can understand if they disliked Annie being abled to cocoon herself and consider it a plot convenience, but come on, the show is about Titans with superpowers. The show hinted at her being able to crystallize part of her body before, so we shouldn't be too surprised if she had the ability to cocoon herself. 

I will not pretend that there is no inconsistency in the story, or if there is not plot convenience. At least for me, Reiner's escape from death in S3P2 is a plot armor, but come on, are you going to nitpick one single detail to call the show trash when the whole story holds together very well? It's not even a big plot convenience. The author could have found another way to keep him alive. 

And last, the political issues in the story are stupid... This is probably the worst criticism one can find against this show. I cannot fathom how the very real political issue of retribution and oppression portrayed in this anime is stupid. If they think a dummy as a King doesn't work in real life, they don't live in real life. The King in this anime lives in the inner most wall, in a heavily guarded and secretive castle. No commoner gets to see the King, so of course they don't know if the King is real or not. Puppet Kings are extremely common throughout history, so I don't know what this criticism is about.

I understand if this show is not for you, but calling it trash is ridiculous.",2021-02-01T19:14:00+00:00,10
"Seasons from 1 to 3 were one of the best anime i have ever watched. I had highs hopes, that final season will be better or as good as the previous seasons. However after watch all 16 episodes i have to say that it was a big disappointment. This season can be a separate anime. There aren't any significant between season 4 and the previous one. You meet old characters but they behave completely different than they used to and we don't know why. New characters are boring. They have one feature and that's all, they doesn't change at all during the whole season. Ontop of that every hero behave very stupid and only stupidity push plot forward. 

When it comes to animation is ok but nothing more. In season 1-3 animation was masterpiece and one of the reason why Attack on titan was so popular. It provides a lot of enjoyment to watch like characters fight, everting looked like a dream.

Nevertheless the biggest problem of this season is story. Plot is just far-fetched, problems that appears beacasue of stupid characters, perfect timing of every action and some magic story armor for some of the heroes. In the past due to story we had fights, now due to fights we have story.

To sum it up i can only say that big expectacions met big disapoinmened.",2021-04-09T08:41:00+00:00,4
"I fail to understand how people enjoy this so much. This was awesome to watch every week, but thinking about it for just a little makes you realize that it isn't very good.StoryThe story this time around is all over the fucking place. It has basically every generic theme that I think the author could think of, and shoves it all into one big story. The second half of the season is where most of the actual ""story"" is, I'm afraid. The first half has bits of monolouge before just a bunch of action, so much so that it's even worse than the first season.The actual story to tell there isn't much of a story if you could call it that, just dialouge to progress the plot. Once we're actually there, the plot is seething with potential. Then the obvious happens, and we're brought back to paradis. Here is where the show understandably becomes a hot mess. But not in a good way. Every theme it attempts to introduce gets rubbed in our face over and over, and comes across as generic. With the idea that they ended season 3 off on, it's only natural that x would be introduced. 

Art + Sound
As someone who has watched a lot of one piece, I can say that art in anime isn't something I'm as worried about, which is sad, because that's the entire fucking point. The art here is pretty meh, with some bad cg integrated into some parts. The music of aot has always been great, but they decided to mix it in with some new different tracks and it doesn't always work.

Character
The new characters that this season introduces are extremely unlikable and poorly written. Only 1 of them gets what you could call ""development,"" but like the rest of the season, it comes across as generic and is thus painfully boring to watch. The chemistry between the old characters is still fantastic, and mixes in perfectly with the new developments and designs. Probably the best aspect of this season.

Verdict
Now that the final season has completely aired, the rating are finally starting to go down, as if you think about it, it's not very good. Aot is not really a good show a lot of the time, honestly, and it really bothers me that people hold it up on such a high pedestal. That being said, part 2 still could be incredible, but I highly doubt it with the directions the new characters are being taken, and the way the final episode ended. This season isn't even good, so 6/10.",2021-04-04T15:49:00+00:00,6
"Tl;Dr:AoT S4 interrogates its own past, proving to audiences just why this giant deserves to stay relevant, 7 years after its premiere. Using the Basement reveal to great effect, S4 opens our eyes to more perspectives in this miserable conflict. Constantly drawing parallels to precedents from past seasons, AoT isn't afraid to recontextualize its formula and challenge ideas that were once accepted without second thought. It's not the strongest AoT has ever been, but has every opportunity to achieve those peaks in a sequel as inevitable as the incoming war. 8/10~***Walls have long been synonymous with the cruel world of Attack on Titan (AoT). Fromthe series' opening moments, these monolithic structures tower over a civilization fighting for survival. On its last legs, mankind makes a final stand with aspirations as high as the barriers themselves: to defeat the enemy and claim the freedom that they rightfully deserve. But in almost 60 episodes of high-octane television, the franchise's trademark bravado gives way to a sinister realization. Perhaps the Walls were never meant to keep the devils out, but to trap them in.

With the secrets of the Basement uncovered, the stakes have been reinvented. Just as freedom seemed ever so tangible for Eren, Mikasa and Armin; S4 places yet another obstacle in their path - one which will take them far beyond the shores of Paradis, and one which will irrevocably tear down the lines between hero and villain. There is no longer Right or Wrong on the battlefield; only Fear persists. ""War makes monsters of us all."" This review is spoiler-free for plot details in S4, but will refer to all prior seasons. With all that out of the way: ""Susume.""

To understand how AoT's latest chapter succeeds, we first need to discuss the game-changing Basement reveal. Naturally, I was skeptical of whether author Hajime Isayama could address the many questions dating back to his story's beginning. The secrets of Grisha's household was always a big driving force for Eren's journey, and it'd be difficult to look back on past episodes fondly if Isayama dropped the ball with his big twist. Thankfully, the Basement reveal proved to be a masterclass in mystery-box storytelling. Providing satisfying answers without the use of plotholes or retcons is a big achievement, but alone isn't what makes these revelations so stellar. Rather, the genius of this premeditated twist lies in how it introduces a new perspective from which we can experience this grand saga unfold. Once the truth came to light, AoT would be changed forever.

S4's introductory arc hits the ground running on uncharted territory. It doesn't take long for the show to make us realise we're a long way from Paradis. Aerodynamic ODM hijinks are traded for conventional trench warfare, monsters from millenia past make way for modern weapons of destruction, and familiar war-torn faces are replaced by new ones - those of young, sprightly children on a siege battlefront. S4's opening salvo boldly thrusts its audience onto enemy soil; but make no mistake, this is AoT through-and-through. While the context has changed dramatically, the same themes and ideas introduced since the very beginning are being expanded upon and reimagined.

AoT reinvents the wheel and finds sympathy for the devil. In contrast to the rapid-fire info dump in the S3P2 episode ""That Day,"" our return to Marley patiently details the various struggles of the evil nation's inhabitants. The use of Titans in warfare kept Marley prosperous for a century, but history teaches us that empires are destined to fall. Other nations have levelled with the former tyrant, and their scrappy spoils of war mark a massive fall from the iron-clad world dominance held in ages past. To a nation edging towards the brink of collapse, their neighbors in Paradis pose a fearsome threat that would certainly prove fatal. With attempts at seizing Eren's rogue Founding Titan only resulting in further colossal losses to their military strength, Marley's position of power lies solely in their control of the narrative. The country's false account of Paradis' past atrocities pits the greater world against an unknown threat, and Marley's Eldians against their own blood. With this backdrop in mind, we observe the tragedy of a disjointed race of outcasts born into a world that seemingly has no place for them. 

Eldia is a house divided, with neither half fully able to stand against their Marleyan masters. Both groups are products of mass subjugation, and S4 claims that the internment Eldians may have received the short end of the stick. In spite of the King's Vow and a vicious fight for survival against the Titans, Paradis is Paradise, because its human inhabitants are spared from ever doubting their place as the good guys. Contrast them with the marginalized Eldians of Marley, whose dehumanized existence is defined by sins of the past. It's an uphill battle, as they are cast down the lower rungs of a merciless social ladder and conditioned to accept self-hatred as a necessity of life. Breaking out of this systematic oppression is what motivates the Warrior candidates, Eldian militants devoted to proving their Marleyan allegiance on the battlefield. With false anti-Eldian propaganda forced down their throats, these soldiers can only repress their humanity as they vie for the coveted Warrior status. Even this best-case scenario confines the ""lucky"" few to 13 years of relentless battle, perpetuating a vicious cycle as one Titan Shifter makes way for the next. It's sad to take in the imagery of child soldiers Gabi and Falco, as they cling onto their flimsy rhetoric in a vain attempt to find order in the sick chaos that surrounds them. While Gabi's abrasive actions drew the ire of countless seething fans^, the script's portrayal of these tragic figures is commendable, especially given the risks involved in fleshing out antagonists so late into the narrative. 

While the sinful children turn to their history books for solace, that comforting illusion of being in the right has begun to show its cracks for some. The battle-hardened Reiner finds himself caught in an ideological crossfire. His cryptic origins are finally explored in-full during this season, detailing the misfortune of having to fight alongside both his motherland and his foes. His split-personality disorder emerged as a result of his time spent behind enemy lines, and coming to terms with Marley's subjugation of Paradis pushed our Armored Titan to his psychological breaking point. Reiner, Gabi and Falco are all forced to confront the suffering dealt by their war cause. No longer is there any comforting doctrine to absolve them from their sins. Warrior Commander Magath says it best, in what is probably my new favorite line in all of AoT: ""There is no doubt that Eldians are the spawn of the devil. And there is no doubt that we are devils ourselves."" Marley's generational sins are coming back to haunt the nation.

It's no coincidence that S4's opening arc closely mirrors the invasion that kicked off the franchise. Much like that first battle in Shiganshina, S4 uses its own powerful moments of despair as a launchpad for the ensuing conflict. This time around, the parallel is recontextualized, as S4 turns the invaders into the invaded. We're presented injustices without innocence, as Marley reap what they sow. At the same time we're shown an enemy coerced into violence as a means of escaping a system of oppression. It's not enough to absolve the internment Eldians of their wrongdoing, but speaks volumes about how Isayama has chosen this new phase of his story. S4 pulls the curtain on everything we thought we knew, finding tragic ambiguity in a conflict that was once simple. AoT achieves this not only through finding sympathy for the devil, but also by smashing its façade of heroism.


The franchise's identity has long been rooted in these soldiers' self-sacrificial blazes of gory glory. Adrenaline-pumping hype was all but guaranteed, as badass scouts sliced-and-diced their way through hordes of giants to the beat of Sawano's steampunk OST. Laying their lives on the line and giving their hearts, mankind would stop at nothing to keep moving forward. Eren and his comrades were fighting for freedom, and as massive manga sales figures (of over 100 million!) would indicate, us passionate fans were rooting for 'em. As I mentioned before, Paradis' place as the good guys was always certain. Rarely were we asked to call our heroes' past actions into question, because their goals were clear and good - kill Titans and claim freedom. But what happens when that fleeting freedom gives way to an unforgiving destiny?

S4 is a sobering deconstruction of its own winning formula. As a Marleyan insider makes the full extent of Eren's powers public, all of Paradis face a dilemma regarding their fate. The mysterious plan could finally secure freedom for the Eldians, deterring the world from annihilating the devils' island. In this new context, old trends make a resurgence. The military remains suspicious of the insider's true motivations, and their inaction seeds distrust among the masses. While us audience members may know that Paradis' government is working for the nation's best interest, it's hard to ignore that their puppet monarchy was achieved through a fascist takeover of the old system. How is their inefficiency that much better than the conspiratory ways of the Reiss reign? Their weak attempts at diplomatic relations are insufficient at appeasing the people, resulting in the emergence of a cult. Dubbed the Jaegerists, this secret society enacts a coordinated strike on the military government. The cult hails Eren and the insider's scheme as divine salvation, and their near-deranged devotion bears strong resemblance to the Wall Priests from past seasons. A chilling demonstration of their desperate faith cemented itself as one of my favorite moments in the entire franchise; as an anti-militant mob chants the ever-familiar ""Shinzo Sasageyo"" back at their opponents, turning a noble call to action into a bloodthirsty mantra. As the domestic chaos ensues, we're moved to wonder just what Paradis stood to gain from ""giving their hearts."" 

Glorified in the past, AoT's heroes are rebuked in the present. Hange, starting out with hopes of changing the old ways that preceded her, now finds herself caged in Commander Erwin's shadow. Armin is forced to accept that diplomacy with other nations will prove ineffective in securing safety for Paradis, as he harnesses the Colossal Titan's destructive power. His loyalty is called into question, with his connection to Bertholdt's memories drawing distrust. Isayama also doesn't spare Mikasa from his scrutiny, as her formidable character comes apart in decisive fashion. Meanwhile, Levi is forced to eat his own words as he laments over the vain loss of countless comrades over the years, because he could never have determined whether trusting in Eren's power was right or wrong until he arrived at the bleak outcome of the present. And as for Eren himself, the strong-willed fighter has been overhauled and nearly unrecognizable. He has emerged as the most resolute figure out of the entire cast, as well as the most inhuman. Eren represents a naive wish for freedom taken to its ideological extreme, and the revelation of his true intentions takes the franchise to the darkest it's ever been.

What is right has become unclear, what is wrong has proven necessary. And it's in the death of those moral constructs that we are able to observe a world driven by fear and hatred above all else. Marley and Paradis are nations trapped in a realist zero-sum game; even though Armin's hopes for diplomacy and cooperation yield the optimal solution for both sides' concerns, fear of the unknown dictates their decisions, leaving them with no other outcome than mutually-assured destruction. Just as lost children stumble their way around a forest, so do soldiers struggle to make the right choice in the heat of battle. All we have are our instincts, the greatest of which being fear. 

AoT's consistency appears to be a double-edged sword in some aspects. AoT's weaknesses are just as present as its strengths, although that's not necessarily a bad thing. Flaws that I'd attribute to the series don't feel like mistakes, but rather a natural consequence of the kind of story Isayama intends to tell. For example, the show's characters are still mostly one-note and thinly-written, but act as superb vehicles for AoT themes as a result. The worldbuilding and narrow political thesis behind the Marleyan-Paradis conflict only functions off unrealistic conditions, but it's because fabricated reality that we're able to witness this truly epic thought experiment. Even though former AoT director Tetsuro isn't on-board this season, it seems that his over-the-top facial reactions and melodrama still found their way into S4. While AoT certainly handles most of its large-scale battle sequences more effectively than its smaller confrontations, it's in these unnerving expressions that showcase our suffering characters giving into their inhuman instincts. For a ""battle shounen,"" the amount of action in S4 is surprisingly lacking, but I'm pleased to see that myself and many others have grown so invested in the painstaking depiction of Isayama's twisted world. The few action sequences we do get do fall ever so slightly short of the gold standard we've grown to expect, but MAPPA have done a mostly remarkable job in handling its animation. CGI usage isn't as rampant here as Twitter makes it out to be, with its infrequent recurrences still blowing the industry standard out of the water. Plus, the change in art direction serves the show incredibly well, capturing a more modern time period while still facilitating Isayama's distinct style.

STRAY RAMBLINGS (SPOILERS):

- ^Real talk, Gabi gets too much hate. It's definitely justifiable to hate her actions and character, but she holds up as a great vehicle for expressing Isayama's message about the dangers of basing your life around political rhetoric and propaganda. Observing audience reactions surrounding her character reminds me of Skyler White from Breaking Bad. The vitriol unjustly targeted at antagonists that are doing their job as, well, antagonists - that just baffles me. The memes are admittedly fire tho, I'll give ya' that.
- Scene of Connie and Sasha realizing their mutual stupidity is basically me and my last two brain cells in college.
- The entire Hizuru plotline didn't click for me. The foreign ambassador is probably the least friendly diplomat I've ever seen, going as far as to lick her lips at the mention of ""national resources."" Anyways, the real issue is that it straight-up doesn't work for Mikasa at all. Like, maybe it's a female-empowerment thingy where our girl is revealed to be some badass princess or whatnot, but Mikasa is never given a reason to care about their proposition, so the whole thread just feels kinda awkward.
- Totally get what the Niccolo motif was going for (he's a chef, Sasha eats his food, etc.,) but associating dinner with her death wasn't really cool when Connie did it the first time, nor was it any less cringe when it gets rehashed in later episodes.
- Floch is a dumbass. 'Nuff said.
- Remember when everyone was malding over ""My War?"" Me neither, that song is a certified banger! For me, ""Guren no Yumiya"" is still gonna be the song I'd associate with the series, but Shinsei Kamattechan's track is the bop I'd put on loop.
- THANK GOD IT'S NOT A MOVIE SEQUEL. Simulcast is a godsend for people that actually enjoy watching stuff without getting spoiled, and I'm already struggling to keep myself safe. Imagine having to go months without the internet before a theatrical release… yeesh. 
- BEST GIRL: Enjoy your meats and potatoes in Heaven, Sasha. Fly high.

Oof, this season really made me grateful for taking up an intro course on Political Studies. I've been relatively late to the AoT hype train, but I don't regret not picking up sooner, as there's so much that I likely wouldn't have appreciated back when I was younger. In any case, I'm well-aboard seeing this massive saga conclude. If you happen to like my verbose rants, feel free to check out my other reviews for seasons past and present~",2021-03-28T08:26:00+00:00,8
"Attack on Titan was the first anime I had ever watched and is the show that got me so addicted to something I never thought I would enjoy. So seeing it come this far and with each season just getting better and better this final season does not disappoint if anything it has already surpassed my expectations. Which is why I decided to make this the first show to review even though i hate nothing more than writing, and all I have to say is MAPPA has done an amazing job and Sundays nights are my favourite. I can't wait for what's to come.",2021-03-06T16:49:00+00:00,10
"This anime is a perfect example of how to start out very good by widening the world further and further for basically 2/3 of a series and then when you actually have to deliver and fill the world with life, meaningful characters, impactful choices and a conclusion - and you fail. The author clearly realized halfway through that he overdid it and couldn't lead all loose ends of the story into something useful together, so he just went by a completely stereotypical ending. And the saddest thing is, he's trying to conceal the fact by the way how hes telling the story: You are quick-swappingconstantly in between 20 years ago - Present - 5 years ago - 15 years ago - 50 years ago - Present - 2 years ago - Present and so on to confuse the viewer to hide the fact that its just your typical random boring ending.

Of course the Art and Sound is unique of this anime - no doubt about it - the production value is awesome. Some fights in this serious overall are the best you gonna see in Anime, but if you rate the characters and story - it's all just a big disappointment. 

This could've been the anime that breaks the standard, but in the end it's just like all these one-hit-wonders: Yes yes, the first season is great and all, but then the thing happens that happens with so many animes like this: the quality of the story drops immensely and nobody really knows or cares whats really going on, as long as we see some nice fight - hence why this series is usually rated so damn high.",2021-03-03T13:42:00+00:00,5
"This is a review for the whole series, not just the latest season. I am also going to re-write this review once the anime is actually concluded. I was absolutely planning to review this series anyway, most likely when it ended... but to be honest, I see so many reviews for this show that are driven entirely by petty emotions... examples being feeling a need to attack other shows because AoT happens to be their favorite and, on the other end of the spectrum, seemingly just being bitter and spiteful because other people love this anime so much. They aren't all like that, but thereare so many that I just wanted to add one more review that isn't motivated by one of those extremes. Obviously I've given this anime a very good score, and I'm not going to pretend I don't love it. But I'm not here to tell you your tastes are bad if you don't think it's the best anime ever... I'm not even here to tell you that I think it's the best anime ever. I don't. I think it has some strengths and some weaknesses, and though I personally found the positives to outweigh the negatives I'm still going to address everything in this review. So with that out of the way, I'll stop rambling and get to it.

In my opinion, the story of Attack on Titan is probably its greatest asset. You'll see a lot of people say that it's overrated, and that's fair- but as an amateur writer myself who's greatest passion is reading and watching stories unfold, I have to admit that I find the quality of the writing here to be pretty plain to see. This is one of those cases where the story seems to have been mapped out from the beginning, which almost always results in better storytelling for me. As the mysteries grow and pieces of the puzzle are eventually revealed, it's very satisfying to see little details fall into place, especially when earlier in the story those same details made you scratch your head in confusion. It may not be the most complex story out there, but it does have an intricacy that holds up better than one might expect under scrutiny. 

For a while the story plays out as a ""mystery box"" that progressively demonstrates to the viewer that there is more to the story that meets the eye. When a story is structured in this way, it does put a certain degree of pressure on those answers to be satisfying when they are ultimately revealed. I do think that AoT executes this very well, but I also think that this may be a point of division among some viewers. I obviously have to tiptoe around spoilers here, but there are some BIG and game-changing reveals that come along and shake the story up quite a bit. For some, this will keep things fresh and exciting... for others, this may alter the DNA of a show that they preferred stay the way that it was. This is practically unavoidable when it comes to long-term storytelling that places so much emphasis on questions and mysteries, seeing as the viewer has a lot of time to theorize on what direction the story might take. If that story ends up being drastically different from what they were expecting- or even hoping- it can certainly be a disappointment. 

However, all I can say is that if you are on board with the turns that AoT takes, there is some fantastic writing to be enjoyed. Not just in the plot, which is filled to the brim with intricate worldbuilding, developments that reframe everything that came before, blurred lines between right and wrong, and enough thematic irony to drown in... but also in the characters and their development. There are definitely some one-note characters, but there are a few characters that have some really interesting growth and exploration. If you like stories that will dive into a character's motivation whether they are the protagonist or the antagonist, there's a solid chance you will be happy with a lot of the characterization in this show. 

I will say that it can take a while to see the depth of the writing here. I'm not saying the show is slow, far from it, but while the pacing kicks off pretty quickly it takes a while before you start to even get a sense of the full picture. Sure, there are some teases and questions that are raised from the start, but for a while they are hidden within a story that seems fairly straight-forward. I actually dropped the show deep into the first season years ago when I first started it. I didn't hate it or anything, I just felt like some of the promising elements were being side-stepped in favor of shocks and action. I can safely say that in hindsight, they were not. If I could say anything to someone watching the first season who is starting to feel like I did, it would be that the promise of added intrigue and development is not an empty one... and that the story absolutely grows as it progresses. Though to be fair, it can be hard to follow at times. Not just because of the story's mysterious nature, but also because there are times when I think there may have been a cleaner way to fill in some of the gaps, especially when it comes to alternating between flashbacks and present time. Though at least it can be said that this story doesn't bog itself down by holding the viewers hand and explaining everything. Overall, though, for me the story is so good that some of these issues seem small in comparison. Others disagree and that's valid, but in the end I think it's just a matter of whether or not the direction that AoT goes is up your ally or not. The biggest downside is that it can take a while to find out whether it is or not, but if you stick with it and find that you do like where things end up then you are in for a wild ride. And despite some of slight bit of controversy among the fandom in regards to just how good this anime actually is, clearly there are a LOT of people who love this story so I'd absolutely say it's worth a chance.

I know that that was a lot of time spent on the story and characters, but that was always going to be the biggest focus of this review. But I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't talk about some of the other elements of this anime, so let's talk about some of the more 'surface level' stuff like the sound and animation. These days, if I were to say the words ""AoT"" and ""controversy"", the first thing that would probably come to most people's mind is ""animation""... but I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself. Let me start by saying that, for the first three seasons, AoT has some of my favorite animation in anime. It's crisp, it has a distinct style, great design, and it just generally seems of high quality to me (though I will admit I am far from an animation connoisseur, and I am probably easier to please than some people out there). But the studio was changed for the fourth season, and you don't have to go too far into reviews or forums to see that some people are disappointed. As for myself: I can absolutely say that I preferred the animation of the previous seasons. However, I think the hate this new style gets is blown way out of proportion, and it's far from being bad. Some episodes are a little more jarring than others, but it never falls below being serviceable. And at the risk of sounding like a broken record, the writing and storytelling that AoT is currently exhibiting is so compelling that it's hard for me to worry much about a somewhat different animation style. I know not everyone agrees with me, but in the grand scheme of this show it really does seem insignificant. And let me say it again, it's not bad.

Finally, let's talk about the sound. The voice acting is top notch, I can think of several great performances throughout the show and cannot think of a single time where I felt that the voice acting was subpar. The voice of Eren in particular is just fantastic. I am referring to the original Japanese voices, I have not seen any of the dub so I can't comment on that. I'm not one to typically pay much attention to the sound effects/design unless it is weird or jarring, so I'll just say that AoT is fine in that department. However, it definitely excels when it comes to the OST. Honestly, this anime has one of my favorite scores out there. It never fails to enhance the episodes and effectively convey the emotion of the scene - whether it's light hearted fun, heartbreak, horror, or most of all, just an utterly epic aesthetic. 

So yes, there are some aspects of this show that I'll rave about. That doesn't mean I think it's perfect, or that this HAS to be the greatest anime ever. It certainly isn't going to please everyone and there are very valid criticisms to make. As I've made clear, I still think it's an impressive show and I honestly expect it to end up being considered as one of the shonen greats alongside FMA:B and HxH(2011). I honestly wouldn't be surprised if, when the show is concluded and providing that the ending is satisfying, I end up changing my rating to a 10/10. To be clear, I don't think that means it's a perfect and flawless series. If that's what a 10/10 score meant, then there wouldn't be a single show that deserved that rating. A 10/10 just means that the show in question was special to the person who rated it. And I think it's equally ridiculous to be angry about people giving an anime a 10/10 as it is for people to give you shit if you don't think it's the greatest anime ever. There's got to be a rational middle ground somewhere, right?

Anyway, I like this show and if you are considering trying it yourself then I think you should give it a shot.",2021-02-15T21:56:00+00:00,9
"Hi guys, this is the first time to write this short review as an anime fan since I was a kid, and a user in this website. In short, AoT is the best anime that has been ever made so far, and this season is just another sequence in this cycle of success and awesomeness that has been aired to the audience. I haven't lived a single episode in this series without having goosebumps all over my body, I would really recommend you to watch it, it's a real enthusiasm and adrenaline giver, and I'm not exaggerating. I'm not even a person who's obsessed byshows or something like that, yet I just can't express how much this show is incredible. Words aren't enough, and this season is truly brilliant and full of surprises that nobody would have even imagined haha I'm writing this after finishing the 7th episode of season 4 the final season unfortunately, and I can't wait for the next episode. 

Have fun guys",2021-01-24T19:05:00+00:00,10
"Attack on Titan Season 4 isn't the best season so far, but it's quite great. Season 3.2 was the best, but now, the story has taken a more serious turn. The story & the art have got a lot better, but the sound could've been better. Also, 16 episode is quite low for an anime.Story: 10.The story started slowly (specially the 1st 3 episodes) but the latter 3 episodes caught up to the story properly & amazingly.  The truth of the Eldians & the Marleans are also revealed. The story has taken a new & darker turn which is awesome.Art: 9.Studio MAPPA is producingthis season. I won't say the art is bad but it could've been better. In episode 6, I didn't even recognize Sasha or Connie. Even Levi's face has changed quite a bit.
Character: 10.
Attack on Titan is probably the only anime with proper character development. The characters didn't developed overnight. I never thought the villains would be so great of this season. Specially, after watching Reiner's past, I cried. It was so intense. But the only thing that's holding AoT back is probably its protagonist Eren Yeager. If only Armin was the protagonist, the story would be mind-blowing.
Overall: 10.
Even though it isn't finished yet, its still quite great. Probably it'll get better by the days.",2021-01-24T09:02:00+00:00,10
"Please if you have the time read this, more people need to be aware and get their head out their own arse for once, this is for the sake and wellbeing of the animators director and everyone working hard on this anime at Mappa.I am not going to give this a proper rating yet (that's why it's a 8) because firstly this show hasn't even fucking finished being animated yet and secondly, more people need to say this but jesus christ stop shitting on the fucking hard work MAPPA are putting in.They have done an amazing job from the direction, pacing, rotoscoping was a nicetouch, the music and animation -including their damn cg- because even if people for some random reason hate 3d animation for the only reason it being in a different fucking dimension, it is fucking needed to stop overworking their already hardworking 2d animators who work their arse off to make fans enjoy a show being animated. 

I think more people need to realise how much effort, hard work and passion go into making an anime, NO OTHER STUDIO WANTED TO TAKE THIS SHOW BUT MAPPA DID.

MAPPA was the saviour for the many ungrateful so called 'fans' shitting on the director for their song choice in certain episodes on twitter essentially degrading him to the point he had to shut down his twitter, the same 'fans' who have now watched episode six most likely on a pirated website where the studio gets no revenue and guess what?? They shit on the animators about the cg like they know anything about it and are simply throwing hate on them for the simple reason of 'It looks bad and ruins the immersion'. Sometimes cg is needed because it's easier to animate especially for heavily detailed objects or characters ie the titans in the fight and tbh for many other reasons i don't know but it's there for a reason. I think Mappa are very good at dealing with cg considering they did Dorohedoro which is basically all cg, and in aot it looks pretty fucking good considering we just aren't used to the 3d titans yet. Yes you can call it a cheap way of animating a couple seconds of frames but jesus christ the 2d animators are already overworked in the anime industry so this cg saves them from literally dying from being overworked. 

Mappa have taken on this show because no other studio wanted to, Wit was done with it.Every other studio couldn't stand up to the hype and pressure or spotlight but Mappa did. They have been on a roll lately with Dorohedoro and and Jujutsu Kaisen. Wit gave us an amazing time with the 3 seasons (4 technically ig) it created for us to watch. Mappa are not only animating the finale of this series for us to enjoy after waiting for so long to see how this story will unfold, it is also juggling other shows like Jujutsu Kaisen. I'm not sure how many people know this but the animation in that show especially the fight scenes are fucking amazing and it hypes me and probably many people up so much for the next progression in the story. They have done an amazing job and I want more people to realise how much hard work their animators are putting into this show for us. 

Please you can have your damn opinions, you can complain without hurting or harassing anyone, just stop shitting on people on twitter or sending death threats to these hardworking people who are literally doing their job that they love, they are trying their best and damn are they doing a good job with the 2 shows they are juggling right now. Thank you for reading my horribly written rant, and I hope this helps at least one person realise that what is going on with the anti 'fans' is not ok in any way shape or form.

Thank you Mappa.",2021-01-18T12:54:00+00:00,8
"This season was a bit of a mixed bag in certain departments, while being pretty much perfect in others. Much like the majority of anime or media in general, rarely are there shows which are 100% perfect in all aspects, but we love the rest enough to look past it anyway. This has applied to pretty much every season of Attack on Titan so far for me, excluding maybe Season 3 Part 2 which I'd argue is the best and most even season overall. Let me go over which parts I thought were excellent and which I thought were somewhat lacking. I'll start with whatI didn't like – the art and animation was a noticeable step down from previous seasons. There was far too much use of CGI titans and characters during action scenes. It was distracting enough to temper my excitement of what was going on, and thus my opinion of the scene overall. I'd say it was the best during the Warhammer Titan's first appearance. Certain dialogue-heavy scenes were also under-animated and somewhat lacking in frames. Comparing this to how polished and beautiful seasons 1 and 2 were in their animation quality and art direction makes it clear how many corners have been cut since, despite the action and storytelling demanding so much more. 

I will also say that I was somewhat let down by the soundtrack. Seasons 1, 2 and 3 all had at least three or four original themes that were masterpieces that I still listen to to this day. This season only had one or two that I thought stood out; I only hope this is supplemented by Season 4 Part 2's soundtrack. I didn't enjoy the music choice for Levi and Zeke's second encounter in the forest much either. 

However, this is all to say that I think the storytelling and character writing has never been better for this series. The seamless transition between different perspectives, flashbacks and exposition is some of the best I've ever seen without feeling like it's dragging, too serious or too tonally dissonant. The motivations and directions some characters take is so unexpected yet satisfying that you can never really predict what will happen next, or choose whose side you're on. The storytelling does an excellent job of showing you multiple perspectives without narrative bias so you as an observer can make the choice yourself; there are no true protagonists or antagonists in Attack on Titan anymore, only who you believe in. The writing, much like the rest of the series, is highly ambiguous and clever, constantly hinting at things that may or may not be answered until much later when it becomes narratively relevant. In my opinion, the storytelling is so good that it makes the ""boring"" dialogue episodes better and more investing than the action-heavy ones.   

If you're a fan of Attack on Titan in any way shape or form, this cour is guaranteed to blow your mind from a story perspective. However, if you're in it for the epic battles and god-tier animation/soundtrack, you may be somewhat let down by this season like I was; if it had been up to the standard presented by earlier episodes, this would've easily been a 10/10.",2021-05-16T01:02:00+00:00,9
"I don't even know what I just watched. It certainly didn't feel like Attack on Titan.Let's start with the atrocious 3D animation that had me feeling like I was watching Berserk 2017. Now most anime these days has some 3D animation. The first few seasons had some but it was designed to be nonintrusive. EXCEPT when they decided on the brilliant idea to animate the colossal titan in 3D last season (they didn't even fix it for the blu-ray. If they had, I would not mention it). You're enjoying this wicked battle between the titans and then you see a 3D animated lump of hugecolossal *ahem*. Well guess what, it gets worse for the final season. You haven't just got the colossal titan in 3D, noooo you've got all of them in 3D now. Every. Last. Major. Titan. It was hard to watch those fight scenes and that's not a good thing when fighting is literally 75% of what Attack on Titan contains.

Now onto the story and characters. Look I don't really know where I expected the story to go, but I didn't expect it to happen the way it did this season and I can officially say I didn't like it. You may like it, but in my opinion it became rather trashy. I haven't read the manga as of yet so I don't know if it's any better, but I cannot understand Eren's choices, or any of the choices that were laid out as actions they could have taken. The other characters address the fact that Eren's choices and the change in his personality are uncharacteristic, but it's to the point that I actually don't even like him as a character anymore. He became this little depressed hoodlum boy wearing his little wonder boy powers on his little finger and I was so ready to yeet this version of Eren into space. Last season he was hella depressed after learning what he did, and it made sense. But where they went with Eren for this season...it's not favourable in my opinion and felt way off the mark for his character. At this point if he really is true on his choices this season and he's not being manipulated or controlled, yeah you can yeet him into the sun. Like in what way did it make sense to him (and Zeke and those who think this is the ideal path) that out of any paths he could take, that that was the best choice? And in what way does it correspond to his character? Yes Eren is an angry little child at times but he does have the ability to reflect and understand right from wrong. It feels like nothing at this point will excuse what he did in Marley or how he treated those around him. Haaaa, perhaps reading the manga would explain all of this but since it's not explained in the 'final season', there goes some points.

Honestly I didn't understand much of the logic behind any of the decisions made by characters who were in a position of power this season. Never mind Armin's incredible power plays were non-existent this season so he might has well have died last season and Erwin having lived (I originally rooted for Armin to make it last season due to his potential to surpass Erwin, but there's not much point now). He should have just pretended to be a coat rack this season, he would have at least been more useful. 

The new gang of characters were a joke as well. None of them could stand up to the characters who had died or had survived this far. Any time a character tried to find meaning or get philosophical in this season, it felt crudely done. All the new characters were generally pretty annoying. Either that or silly and stupid. All of the new characters were designed to show a different stance one may take in a war, as in what side you support and why you choose that side (or at least it felt like this was their only purpose for existing this season due to how forceful it felt). Examples of why could include brainwashing, finding love, greed, or maybe not even supporting a side at all. Yet it was all too forced, particularly Gabi. Yes she's got some hardcore naivety and brainwashing going on, but her character didn't feel genuine and every aspect of her character was annoying. She's similar to Eren in terms of her anger and fighting spirit, but at least Eren had more aspects to him even as a child and he was likeable. All I wanted to do was yeet her into the sun along with the final season version of Eren. Actually scrap that, I'm to the point of yeeting this entire season into the sun.

Being thrust into a jumbled story line also really didn't help. It felt bewildering. Why am I here watching these half-baked annoying children for how many episodes? Where's Eren, Levi, Mikasa, Armin and the rest of the survivors? You take a risk when introducing characters to a story in this way. If the characters don't stand up to those already in the story or show potential, it's going to flop. You also manage to annoy viewers and disorientate them if you don't succeed. They should have reconsidered the layout for the final season. 

I also wasn't much of a fan of the timeskip either and then constantly going back and forth between what happened over the last few years. I don't mind when it's happened in the past seasons (however these timeskips have mostly been to quickly cover changes in politics, buildings, or growth that didn't need to be seen), but it didn't feel right this season the way it was done, especially with how many years the timeskip spanned and then having to jump back and forth to find out what happened. It felt out of place to use it to such an extent for the final season. It also probably didn't help that as soon as I saw the characters grown up (after you're done with the new kids in the first episodes) they didn't feel the same and they all fell rather flat. For me personally, I needed to adjust to the older versions which could have been through changing the timeline layout so that I could see the characters grow more in a somewhat more linear timeline. Yet even then, I didn't really like how any of the characters changed. They just remained flatter than the previous seasons. Only Levi seemed to actually remain somewhat the same but because he alone didn't seem to change, everyone else seemed alien or half of what they were. Even with what happened to Sasha, I barely felt anything. Yet if what happened to her occurred in the previous season or the season before that, I can assure you my life would never be the same.

Basically, it's up to you whether you enjoy it or not. I personally didn't and felt it was a waste of time waiting for it. I can officially say now that for me personally, AOT ended at Season 3 Part 2. I'd rather the tragic cliff hanger of learning how cruel humans can be to orchestrate such evil actions than accept this trashy and poorly written finale that strips characters of their personalities and likability, leaves behind plot hole after plot hole and clearly shows there was just no dedication put into finishing AOT well and blimey it hurts.",2021-04-10T08:05:00+00:00,4
"All right. What I am going to say is meant to make people understand that this isn't what they came for, nor will it ever be.Attack on Titan was very good at the beginning. Even now, it isn't as bad as people make it out to be. It's a good show, but this clearly doesn't make it the best show out there. People aren't salty that their best show is run over and destroyed by ""The Final Season"". It's simply the fandom. They took over, trolled the reviews, gave FMA:B, Steins;Gate, Gintama, HxH and many more a 1 because why not (because that makes sense)and pushed the fact that this season was the best down our throats as much as they could. I'm sick of the fandom and their religious cult around this show. Many people just don't give a fuck anymore about the series because of some fans' delusions. This is beyond insanity, just like their favorite main character, Eren Yaeger. You haven't learned anything haven't you, AoT fans? A good season is a good season. Pumping it to first place just creates disillusions for other people. I fully understand that the show was full of tension and excitement, but this is beyond complete and utter brain rot. Downrating some of the best shows ever made simply shows that you can't take criticism and actual facts about your show. The Attack on Titan fandom is the worst fandom out there, and a simple person who read until now understands this all too well. Anyone would. I know I'm being salty and toxic, but somebody had to say this. And some of you should accept this fact.

Now that I'm done ranting and yelling at Eren Yaeger fans, I guess I should get into the review. Yes, it contains spoilers.

Attack on Titan is the first name someone would think of when hearing the word ""anime"". It's so popular that it attracted non-anime watchers and has made itself the so-called ""face"" of anime. And it sometimes lives up to the hype. The story and the characters evolved as intended, the visuals look nice and I enjoyed most of the show.

Starting with the plot: of course, it follows the manga very well, but it felt very stretched. I suddenly felt like I wasn't watching Attack on Titan at some point. The genre got completely switched from a full-action to a drama, and then back to full-action right at the end. It was meant to explain everything that was happening and evolve the plan of the Yaegerists. The story focused on only the scouts as the revolution began in the background, right behind their backs. It's a very well thought-out concept, but the execution was so poor that I almost died of boredom. 4 episodes were just talking, and talking, and talking, and oh my god, when was it going to end?! But, in spite of the very stretched dialogue and mediocre character development, these 4 episodes set up a good pretext for the revolution. It wasn't bad, nor was it good. It was too long, the characters got random character development and the drama went on and on until we reached the table scene. Other than that, there is symbolism. Like the argument between Nicolo and Sasha's father. The political problems of each country and their hatred took over Nicolo, making him a representation of Marley, meanwhile Sasha's father very calmly wanted to solve the issue, just like Eldians wanted to before Eren Yaeger came into play. It's a sweet little scene that caught my attention, and it was for a very good reason. +1 point for symbolism! Metaphors like this one are all scattered through the show, even if Mappa didn't highlight them as they should've. I'll let you find all of them.

Moving on! My favorite subject: the characters. First and foremost, Eren Yaeger is not the greatest character out there, nor is he the best protagonist to ever exist. He's simply a hollow corpse that shouts ""Free will! Freedom! Euthanasia!"" whenever he gets the chance, thinking he's a deep and philosophical character. Indeed, he is a very well thought-out character. The transition to a villain (from the Scouts' perspective) was very nice from the mangaka, a nice plot twist that has never been done before (clearly sarcastic). But the biggest flaw that he has is that there's no more substance to him. He has reduced himself to an empty shell, a character without remorse or feeling; basically close to complete insanity, if it weren't for Zeke. He abandoned his friends and the Scouts for the sympathy of a long-lost brother from the Land of Marley. Saving Mikasa from the you-know-what incident back when they were kids was just a front Eren used to put up back then. Now, he woke up to ""reality"", as he calls it, and chose to fight against his own comrades. A very strategic coup-d'état. But this doesn't obstruct the clear mistakes and flaws in his character. I never wanted to have a husk of a protagonist lead an amazing revolution (and somehow succeeding). I thought the show would have a more complex character for Eren, but I have been disappointed once again. Mikasa and Armin are basically a joke right now. Mikasa grew from never wanting to leave Eren to never seeing Eren again. For a couple of episodes. Armin, now possessing the Colossal Titan, actually got some decent character development; him agreeing with Eren's ideology will probably advance the plot even further, but the difference here is that Armin isn't a husk. The things he believed in before are still there, but the new methods of the Yaegerists infiltrated his mind only to fill him with doubt. At least that's how I feel about the last scene. The one I'm most disappointed in though must be Hange. She went from a complete fanatic that was obsessed with titans, an actual character that I cared about and one of the funniest characters from the cast to just a tool for the revolution. She doesn;t even do her usual skits or random sparks that strike greatness. No smart ideas came from her this entire season. Maybe it was meant to be, but I can't control what the mangaka wants. I just give my opinion on what was good and what was bad, right?

The sound design and animations are very clean. This time, Mappa had to deal with a massive show. The first 3 seasons were a very big milestone to achieve, and a hard one to overcome, but in this category (and this category only), they prevailed. The animations were a nice surprise, and the sound accompanying them couldn't be better. Unfortunately, this is the only side where Mappa actually did a decent job. 

As for enjoyment, I guess saying that it didn't really satisfy me is a good conclusion. The story was as expected, with some plot-holes and mistakes (that were usually rare); the characters were a complete disappointment and the sound and animations were above expectations. People come to see a very good show, mostly when they see a (currently) 9.09 score; a show that is very close to number one. But this isn't what they should be greeted with. It definitely deserves an 8.50, maybe even an 8.75, but going as close as Steins;gate and FMA:B is a shame for the anime industry.

Maybe you'll find enjoyment in it more than I did. Maybe you're a Yaegerist reading this review only to flag it because of some harassment you thought I mentioned. Maybe you watched the series and didn't quite enjoy it as people said you would. I recommend we all rejoice and put a fist to our hearts, and one to our backs to say once again: ""How in the ungodly fuck do you do a part 2 to a season called &lt;&lt;The Final Season&gt;&gt;?""

"***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***This is going to be a very long and Honest review coming from a big fan and lover of Attack on Titan so if you have the patience, let's sit down because I have a lot to talk. Before I start reviewing this, I just want you to know that I'm being the most unbiased I can while writing this, I in no way see myself as a hater of any sort (I obviously don't condone the harassment the staff had to go through), I'm just a fan who really loves very much Attack on Titan, but that doesn't mean I justhave to accept whatever is being thrown at me without questioning and criticizing anything.

So before voting on my review or going on my profile and leaving comments demanding me to be grateful, I wish you could read my whole honest rant, even if you disagree with me, and think with me what aspects could've been done better in this adaptation. 

Shingeki No kyojin is a modern masterpiece. Its a very ambitious story that tackles many realistic themes of war and racism. It has many unpredictable plot twists, no character is safe from death which makes it more unpredictable. Its original and creative

I love, every aspect of this world that was made possible by Hajime Isayama and his phenomenal storytelling, making it one of the best manga of modern age. It makes me sad to see such a potential of a great manga being wasted like this.

Before watching AOT back in 2015, I wasn't very familiar with anime, I had just seen a couple of ones like Death note and Elfen lied but I viewed most of animes as mindless brawl action, so I usually enjoyed more movies and ignored anime, but that was before a friend insisted I should watch Attack on titan (Thanks homie, I miss you).
 
Everything changed when I saw the first episode of Aot. The art, the extraordinary direction and the emotion put into it made me realize that I was missing a lot, and it sucked me into the universe of Anime and that's when I saw how wrong I was.  

It was the first anime that made me grow as a person and made me view anime as a viable type of media and form of art just like any movie or book. 
So you can see how much important Attack on Titan is for me, and how much it inspires me. So I think I have just as many rights as anyone to say how much I'm disappointed with the new season.  

In case you haven't noticed a new studio is taking charge of this last season, Studio Mappa, a very good studio, who has recently animated Jujutsu Kaisen which is spectacular, but this studio, unfortunately, is just taking way too many projects at once to animate, so far they took 6 anime projects in 2020 along with Shingeki No Kyojin, and if I recall correctly they are soon to animate Chainsaw Man, thus overworking their crew to exhaustion.

Honestly, I don't want to be harsh, I am aware of the schedule problems this new studio is facing with the last season of SNK but I still have to be honest; compared to other seasons, SNK final season (at least part 1) is mediocre, it's noticeably full of problem.

~I deleted my old review since I cant update the episodes. So I will post the same review again~

-Story (9)

Nothing much to say about this. The pacing is pretty good (except for episode 3 which was the most butchered and rushed episode so far)
In general, most episodes follow the manga well with just some minor and acceptable cuts. I don't have a lot to complain about here, the brilliant story written by Isayama is what it's carrying this season so far

-Art (6)

Don’t expect a lot from animation this season, it’s a downgrade compared to previous seasons. The new studio had a lot of trouble with the production and it shows, especially in action scenes sadly.

I'm not a big fan of the color gradings and the blur,it takes out all the details of the drawings for me, and its not satisfying to look at all.

The background art that should give LIFE to the story and make the world-building more believable isn't as detailed this season as before. The use of Blur also doesn't help very much.

The art design seems alright at times, but I've noticed that some characters suffer from ""inconsistencies"" in their drawing, particularly Eren, which I find it strange since he is such a major character in this series, and frankly... he is HOT, he should be hot in the anime every time he's on screen. In case you are wondering... yes, yes I am gay for Eren.

Anyways, there are so many moments in the anime that he looks so off and ugly.
For example in episode 4, his face looks chubby if you compare him with episode 5 where he looks way more handsome there, it's like he was drawn by two completely different persons with different art styles, its strange and very noticeable, so don't think I paused every frame to nitpick, that was something that I casually noticed and intrigued me.

I could give many other examples of weird Eren drawings from this season (like the Iconic mirror scene, oh boy, they didn't serve my man justice here) but I don't want to extend myself too much about this. Other characters also suffer from inconsistencies sometimes and they can also look off if you pay close attention (Pixis, Floch, Jean, Mikasa).

Meanwhile, other characters like Armin, Levi, and Hange are always consistently so well drawn and they always look gorgeous. It makes me wonder if Mappa has a preference for these characters hmm...

I think the art in this season sins a lot if you compare it with the manga. Everything in the manga just looks better. Characters are generally more expressive in the manga compared to the anime and I think this is the biggest con that affects a lot of good moments that should give us impact and feel special.

*Now I will dive into spoiler area, if you haven’t seen the anime yet you can just ignore this paragraph and move on to the Sounds review*

A very good example of what I'm saying: When Eren sees Mikasa again for the first time in ep 6, the famous scene of ""Eren please come home"", this in the manga is a Masterpiece and it's very Iconic.
This scene is supposed to feel very emotional, and it has very little dialogue, everything is conveyed through their facial expressions.
After so many years without seeing Eren, Mikasa comes back to Marley and when she sees him again, he has just killed hundreds of innocent lives. He is clearly not the same, and this breaks Mikasa, she wants to cry, tears leak from her sad gaze, this also breaks Eren, at first he seems unaffected, but his expressions shifts slightly until he looks at her with a subtle hint of pain in his eyes, you can see straight into his eyes that this is not what he wanted, he seems like he wants to say sorry, but he can't, he has to move forward until his enemies are destroyed. This is one of my favorite moments in the manga, the way their facial expression was drawn is Brilliant, and every detail mattered. It's so beautiful and well-drawn it brings a tear to my eye every time I think about the manga panels.
Now in the anime...... it's different, and I mean in a bad way.
It's just so dull, the way Mikasa's crying was drawn is just weird.
Eren was badly drawn, he is ugly compared to the manga art style and he is just unexpressive, furthermore, the way he was drawn in the anime implies that he doesn’t give A SINGLE FUCK when he looks back at Mikasa. This is just such a disrespect to the original work that it makes me not only disappointed but sad to know that we won’t get anything better than this.


-Sound (4):

Ok let’s move on to the sounds before I write a novel and this gets too lengthy. THE SOUNDS; are one of the most lacking aspects of this season. This time we have Two composers: Hiroyuki Sawano and Kohta Yamamoto.

The soundtrack from Sawano is basically the same as earlier seasons, with some samples being remixed here and there but it's essentially the same thing, nothing new.

What is new in this season is KOHTA YAMAMOTO, a new composer from this season that apparently his best work right now is that song from the trailer, which is repeated throughout the whole season tirelessly. Over and over again, I mean… It’s a cool song, I don’t think it has anything special compared to the best works of Sawano, but I mean… it's still alright, generic, but alright.
What's not alright is that this is the only new song that I’ve heard so far in this season. Every chance there is, this song will inevitably play. Doesn’t this Yamamoto guy have anything else to offer besides the OST from the trailer? Really? Why isn’t there anything new besides that????

Ost this season is not very memorable, it's just the same as before and there aren’t many impactful moments with it. Unlike previous seasons with the direction of Tetsuro Araki, you can notice that this new staff is struggling to fit the classic Sawano Ost’s with the scenes and make them great and spine-chilling.

It's the poorest aspect of this season so that's why I gave it a 4.
Important moments that should leave THAT BIG IMPRESSION on you with memorable music are lacking in this season.

-Character (7):

Although I love Shingeki, I have to admit that one of the weakest aspects of Hajime Isayama is the characters. Most of them are pretty one-dimensional with a few exceptions.
Minor characters like Connie, Sasha, Levi (yes even him) get very underdeveloped and all they have is just one character trait, but this is still passable, not many writers give minor characters a lot of attention.
Still, you know it's not a good sign when some minor characters (Like Jean or Hange) get better development than major ones like Mikasa.

Mikasa is a very weak one-dimensional character that just felt like a supporting cast this whole season. Armin used to be a good character but I think he gets pretty boring and empty after he reaches his goals in season 3.

Eren is surprisingly the most interesting character in this season, (I think Reiner is very well written too, but his arc was better handled in the manga in my opinion)
Eren, along with Reiner, is the most brilliant character in this story.
He actually develops a lot and he becomes a very cool and ambiguous character, and it still makes sense in the context of everything, but on the other hand, it's kinda bad that he is not the main character at this point of the story.
Why? Because we don’t get to see more of his development in this arc. I know everything about Eren is supposed to be a mystery since everything happens after a time skip and we don’t get to see things from his perspectives. We mostly see pieces of his development from other perspectives through flashbacks.

-Enjoyment (6):

Overall I didn’t felt any joy watching this season, everything from Art to Sounds and direction was dull and I didn’t felt the same emotions I had with the manga or previous seasons. I simply felt nothing watching this.
it's sad, I wish I could at least enjoy this season like many seemed to enjoy but it just isn’t for me. Every week I had a lot of excitement waiting for Sunday so I could watch the new episodes.
I won't say that everything was bad, there were some good moments, but they didn't outshine the disappointing ones for me.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what was disappointing, I just felt that some things were off with this season, everything you see in S4 was unfortunately done better in the manga, the anime struggled to deliver the best moments from the manga, and I think the anime had major problems with direction and music overall.

This is rare since we're talking about the anime that always used to be more enjoyable compared to the manga in the former seasons.

It saddens me to see that this adaptation has turned into an empty shell of its former self and It could’ve been so much better. It's just a waste of good material. I hope Mappa can redeem itself next time in part 2 because I can still see their potential.

-Overall (6):

Everything in this season is just okay… but nothing feels impactful. Sadly, nothing hit the spot due to the flat direction, storyboard, editing, and music. I can still overlook the animation which was disappointing but it's understandable considering the schedule Mappa had, but things like Direction and editing can't be overlooked.

And I also have the impression that no love was put into this adaptation, sorry for all the people who like to say otherwise but I didn't felt that at all when I watched this adaptation. 

In my opinion, this adaptation is emotionless and has no charm and sense of uniqueness, I can easily feel when its a passion project or not. And this is an empty rushed project that was made for the sake of the job and reaching the deadlines. (I know this is controversial and the fandom may want my head for this, but who cares, I'm free) 

I’d recommend reading the manga if you want to feel deeper emotions because everything just feels better there. The drawings have more depth and it just does a better job at telling a story and conveying emotions compared to the Anime.
 
It saddens me that there are so many employees at Mappa being extremely overworked and underpaid for this. People praise and root for Studios companies like they are some sort of Football Team, lol grow up, the anime industry is rotten, I don't care about this whole Mappa vs WIT war that is going on in the internet.",2021-03-28T15:27:00+00:00,6
"Pieck has a fat ass, its not to big not to small it's just the right size. although i don't like Pieck's titan form, while as a human she is a masterpiece. there are other characters like Mikasa, Sasha, Levi, and Commander Magath but they all still peril in comparison to Pieck's fat ass. Pieck also like's to keep a bond with the members of the group that rides her ( not sexually, please don't take it that way) which further more proves how fat of an ass Pieck has. if anyone disagrees with me you will hereby be wrong for all eternity. concluding myfacts this is why i will be rating the final season with a well deserving 10/10.",2021-03-26T03:05:00+00:00,10
"this is a rewritten review since the original is taken down for some weird reason  this contains spoilers for the manga latest chapters too .If you watched evangelion, gender blue , macross,any war movie or any gundam series and you know some norse mytheolgy you basically watched aot and no its not that it get inspirations from or paying hommage or even deconstract . it steals an aspect from each piece and put it into one giant plotThe word « masterpiece » realy lost its meaning in the weeb comunity didnt it ? now evreything is a msterpiece apperently black clover is a masterpiece, naruto is a masterpiece and now this
.
aot fandom is not in any shape or form tolerant with criticism they will harrass you - probably send you some death threats- or they wont even cosider you a humanbeing for not liking their bible so I hope none of them finds out about this review I dont want to deal with those tards
as am gonna explain at the end of this why this has to be the single most toxic anime fandom ever
.
so aot :
we all know the story so lets just jump into it
1- technical issues :
the rules when it comes to titans and especilly titan shifting is vague which allows the writer to come up with any asspulls and dieux ex machina for examples :
A- why didnt ymir turn into the jaw titan when she trunsforms instead she shifts into her normal (original) titan form
B- manga spoilers : how did falco turn into the bird titan how could this even happen can shifters now turn into anything they want to lol (the reason they made in the manga was that falco was exposed to Zeke's spinal fluid but that would make any human who turned into a titan be a beast titan of some sort but they all turned into normal titans ) and why a flying titan exactly ? why not a giant monkey like zeke ? or a huge turtle ? lol because its a dieux ex machina since it used to convieniatly helps the main characters to fly above eren
C- C - how did eren control ymirs power ? after he gave her two words into her ear ? so you telling me that this entity that lives only for serving the royal family for thousands of years change its loyality for eren just because he huged her and and literly sayed two words to her ??? this is talk no jetsu tooken to the extreme, this is a prime example of how the writer plays wth the rules to fool the audience and its cheap writing
D- world building flaws :
D1- why did marley send bunch of kids or even trust them with titan shifting powers to attack another nation I get it sending those eldian human teens to fight in war is understandable since they re sucrfising them without consider them as proper casualty also they’re under mature leadership commands but to actually trust them and send them alone and to wait for them to come up with results is just dumb( and they do fuck up btw and because of that they lost the female titan, the jaw titan and the colossal titan ) couldnt they just trust some older eldians to do it ? if they fear treason they could just wait for those chosed ones to grow up older and send them then
D2-(manga spoilers here I NEVER UNDERSTOOD how the power of wall titans WORKS EXACTLY IMEAN THE WORLD IS SO FUCKING BIG THIS PLANET IS 510.1 million km² BIG AND YOU TELL ME THAT SOME 50 METERS TITANS THAT WERE UNLOCKED IN A TINY PLACE IN A TINY ISLAND ARE TAMPING ON ALL OF THE surface AND HUMANs IN THIS WORLD are trapped without any shelter AND NO ONE IS LEFT??!!!! LOL THIS IS JUST TOO STUPID TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY
D3- ymir as a plot device is very inconsistent, the writer used her to come up with any convenience to plot armor the characters first they told us she obeys the royal family only and she have no will nor she can make any decision without a permission from a member of the royal family then eren told her three words to encourage her (talk no jutsu) and suddenly he possess her power then they told us that she wants freedom now even though it makes no sense but they changed her motivation again and told us that yumir wants the people to come together all along lol which results in power of friendship in the later chapters
E- the convenient amnesia that eren have doesn't even make any sense why did he lost his memory about his fathers part in the first place ?

2- characters :
to start with characters designs are bland, lame and forgettable for exception of very few you can take those designs and put them in any generic anime and they will fit in perfectly and no its not that it supposed to be realistic this isn't an excuse you can make realistic character designs and keep them look intresting some good examples of this are vagabond , berserk , slam dank , paranoia agent , monster……….
wait till you see the actual writing of these characters .
the writer use a very cheap method called « pre-characterisation building pieces » to write those characters you can notice that if you been watching anime and movies for long time the writer use pre-used pieces of characteristics in other works and put it with very little contribution to it and the result : characters that feels deep and original to the casual ppl who never saw much before but shallow and repetetive to those who acually excperienced stuff
also these charcters dont feel like actual peapole they feel like they belong only in shounen anime world
lets start with eren I guess :
eren :
* before his development:
this guy is the most two dimensional character you could ever see he eaither crying or angry and yelling at evreyone all the time he acts angry and yells even in a normal conversations and that makes him laughably bad
there are alot of stupid excuses for this that the fans come up with some of which are :
hE sAw HiS mOm DiEs aNd tHaTs wHy hE acTs likE tHiS :
- first of his mom dying doesnt make him two dimentional in fact it supposed to add more depth and dimensions to his character
-Second EVEN BEFORE HIS MOTHERS DEATH HE WAS ALWAYS ACTING LIKE THIS !!!!!!!!!!
bUt tHiS iS tHe POiNt tO mAkE hiM sOuNdS likE tYpiCalL sHoUnEn PRoTaGeNiSTs
THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE you can do that gimmick without making your character so two dimentional
good example is gon from hxh this kid feels like your typicall shounen hero but he always felt like a real kid who ‘s been thrown in a fucked up world he was three dimentional with alot of nuances and subtlety from the beginning you notice he’s deffrent from other shonen heros without putting your finger on it his character development was inevitable due to the circumstances he encounters when he finally changed you know this is eventually gonna happen because of the hints that dropped through out the anime
No back to eren they showed that he was a psychopath from his childhood whe he saved mikasa by brutally killing those kidnapers but that didnt make any sense for a kid who grow up in a very loving enviremont hell his mom was very protective of him the worst thing that could happen to him in daily life were some bullies lol
This goes to show how the writer doesnt understand how human works nor he have some understanding of children psychology
another evidence of pre- characterization building pieces without understanding why those charcteristics he stole exist in the first place
• After his development :
he went emo mode its your typical naruto villain the good boy who turns into the super villain that wants to desroy the world we saw that millions of times
« bUt tHe diFFrEnCe iS tHat He’s jUstiFiEd « no shit he’s justified any one should be justified in any revenge story haveyou ever watched a revenge story with no justification ????
this trope of turning main protagenist into main antagonists is a common trope in writing

it was done better with lights character from death note he was the main protagonist and antagonist at the same time and he felt like a real humanbeing with god complex

hell kanekei’s devlopment in tokyo ghoul re manga is so identical to eren’s to the point that I would say that some plagiarism is happening here I wont be suprised if thats true consedring aots track record of stealing
.
Mikasa : this girl literally have zero personality to her characeter im struggling to name one characteristic in her . I can summarize her character into one word « eren » thats it im sure now some aot tard is now typing a bible length essay to explain why she’s not this bland and why she loves eren
I mean I get it eren saved her and gave her a reason to live but thats not excuse to turn her into erens dog with no personality whatsoever this is just bad writing
.
armin : armin has the most personality out of the three main characters I guess but thats it he’s you typical « im the weak guy but also the smartest guy in te room im gonna use my gigga brain to make up for my weak body and pesonality «
.
Levi : the geniric cool badass senpai . much like eren he’s two dimensional he’s either too cool to do anything or just so pissed not as bad as eren though because there are some subtleties with him
his action scenes are the worst tho because they diverted from any logic and challenge the physics of this anime there are times when he turns into a humanbeyblade lmao IM not mentioning the almost mind isulting plot armor around this guy
.
Erwin : behold evreyone - the worst leader to ever exist in fiction – to sum up his character imagine playing football and instead of coming up with strategies nd tactics and balancing the team to increase your ball possession or scoring chances you just order your team to go all attack at once even the Goalkeeper and go back all to deffense at once
this is his charcter he’s a jihadist if he dont manage for a suicidal attack his plans never works lol he sacrificed hundreds of thousands of his soldiers with no results for the most part with a reminder that they are runing out of human resources lol without help of levi or titan eren this guy cant achieve anything no wonder humanity coudlnt go any further under his leadership
the first plan to capture the female titan cost him the survey corps squad and almost losing eren against just one person
and his last time was in Return to Shiganshina arc when : first he went to the battlefield blindly without sending any scout unit to inform them forward of any sudden changes no moving army go blindly to enemies territory lol and the result of that they got trapped
second to figure out where is reinar and birtholt he trusted a hunch of a young soldier lol
he’s a terrible strategist how did they made this guy a leader lol
.
Jean : a comic relief
Sasha :a comic relief
Connie : a comic relief
Hanji :a comic relief her death was stupid tho
there are alot of comic relif for a dark anime huh
.
Historia : just a plot device she’s literally waiting just for someone to impregnate her now , thats her arc lol im not joking btw thats her entire arc after she became the queen or whatever
.
Reinar :
Eisily the best character in the show this is the actual protagonist of the story he shows more emotions and self conflict more than any character here – he struggles with himself there ‘s a side of him where he has to prove himself among the Marleyans to clear his ancestors name but when he went to paradise and lived with the eldians for along time he grow an attach to them he learned they arent the demons as evreyone perceive them
great conflict and the fact that he has Schizophrenia is a nice little detail that ad depth to him and make him intresting
zeke : is good the second best character in the show –
I dont care about other characters and it seems no one does not even the writer lol
3- dialogue :
This has to be one of the worst dialogues out there – dialogue reflects its characters so you can tell whats the quality of this one lol
the dialogue in AOT feels the need to waste its time by explaining to the viewer directly the mentalities ,feelings and moralities of this characters instead of moving the plot further
a good dialogue should give you those informations about charcters -feelings and their personalities and their mentalities – indirectly you get those informations from how the character is talking or which words it uses all of that comes naturally in conversations . it never stops to tell the story nor it stop to flesh the characters out and that needs talent and experience
I gurntee that at least 70% of aot dialogue is just charcters keep explaining their feelings to other characters with little contribution to the actual plot this is the cheapest way possible to flesh the characters sometimes they spent entire epsoides with nothing happens just chatacters discuss their mentalities and idiologies sometimes they spent an entire arcs just about them discussing their feelings lol ( the recent arc is a prime example of this and this is the last arc of the series !!!!!)
that makes aot dialogue shalow it seems deep to those who dont know how actual dialogue works
You can take a huge chunk of its dialogue and the story wont change much . also its repetetive sometimes I can predict what the other character is gonna say or even worst I can tell from which movie or anime that piece of dialogue is originally taken from lol
.
the characters sometimes stop the fight to have a typical shounen conversation discussing their ideologies in the middle of the battle lol
* things I acually like in AOT :
1- action : aot has some of best written action in recent memory due to its
A- fast pacing
B- the details that were put in the Vertical maneuvering equipment
the best kind of action is the action where characters have limited tools to fight with and the manoever gear represent that perfectly
the gas would run out which make it very fatal and the fact that the baldes are changable is very dynamic and logical since blade do get ruined when they used
the entire mechanism is very fascinating to me
C- the brutality of these deaths
D – the camera movement which put you in prepective of those soliders

.
However it was ruined by the stupid monologues that we talked about erlier and the plot armor that surround certain characters

2- the worldbuilding I guess : its fine I guess since its just a mix up between macross and gender blue with norse mytheology but the writer managed to add his touch to it I liked some geopolitical plots but for the most part they are repetetive if you watched any political anime aot is taking from it
.
3- the comedy : yes the comedy especially the unintentional ones – because the characters are sometimes over the top it manage to take a laugh out of me especially when it comes to eren mikasa and levi
also sometimes they go so extra with the titans and how chaotic they are
the the intenional comedy was good too

The grey area :
things Idont like nor I hate :
Background : I never in my life have I ever saw bacgrounds that looks so pretty and yet its so soulless the background( wit studios background) even though they put tons of effort behind them they still lacking so much in details especially visualising the « Mise-en-scène » it feels empty of life and just pretty boxs that contains our charcters
its really shame how they put so much effort in drawning those backgrounds but not to make them alive and dynamic

Dialogue 1/10
Charcters 4/10
Plot 5/10
worldbuilding 5/10
Art 7/10
sound 8/10
Action 8/10

Its far from good its just lil above average . its good for casual anime fans but if youre a hardcore anime fan I wont recomanded you’ll waste your time at least I GOT SOME ENTERTAINMENT FROM IT BUT YOU NEED TO DIG HARD VERY VERY HARD O FIND SOMETHING DECENT

.
lets talk now about the fandom :
this is the fandom that :
1- harrassed / send death threats to the director just because he didnt include their favourite ost in a certain scene !!!!!!!
2- send hundreds of death threat letters for voice actor because she voiced a charcter that they hate
3- harrassed the staff members who puts alot of effort to make this anime for them
4- downvote evrey other anime just to make their anime rise to the top in rating sites
5- giving an epsode score of 10/10 before it even dropp lol
6- will harrss you annoy you disrespect you because you didnt like their midiocre cartoon
7- the biggest anime community with fujoshis second only to mha fandom
Do I need to say more this fanbase is terrible by all means",2021-03-25T01:07:00+00:00,5
"if spoilers dont careAttack on Titan wasn't really anything that good until the airing of the third season and this one goes to say how good the show is. It is in no way a 10/10 no flaws show, the art wasn't the best, CGI in places unwanted (same with the other seasons) and honestly isn't too clean. The story took a massive turn after the ending of season 3 part 2 which I dislike as suddenly changing a characters perspective and the way the act over remembering a few things isn't too good writing in my opinion and isn't too appealing. The sound isgood but nothing too special or unique. Characters are the same, massive hate for Gabi that little bitch and eren isn't too good of a character anymore hes just an edgy fuck who wants to kill everybody. This season mostly focuses on developing the story after the war hammer titan had been eaten, action is barely present in the rest of the episodes. 

story - 8/10
art - 6/10
sound - 8/10
character - 7/10
enjoyment - 7/10
overall - 8/10
Attack on Titan is not 10/10. Stop being a brain dead retard and realise its barely a 8-9 and i hope to see y'all rating it a 10/10 after the ending.",2021-03-10T01:42:00+00:00,8
"Season 4 is far below what we were used to having. And I’m not talking about the change of staff and therefore of style.No this is the cause of a more than chaotic schedule and a huge lack of time.I see a lot of people being very happy about the current season, but this joy is clearly not objective and is there because we are talking about snk which includes a huge hype.But the facts are there, this season is below the other 3 in terms of quality, the action scenes are the proof with the use of the CGI to save time on deadlines.Theaction scenes are incomparable to what we’ve had in the past.
The designs of the characters are also missed. And in this way, Eren is the big loser. In all key moments the character is ugly.
His titan is ugly. His human form is ugly. Practically none of the key moments concerning him are successful.

However being a huge fan of the show, I can not follow this season because I am literally disgusted with what snk became for money.
Just seeing it with a higher grade than the old ones when it’s the least good makes my heart hurt.

You have the right to love this season, everyone has the right to love what he wants, but this is insulting about the work of others. I don’t mean to say that the work of WIT is better than the work of MAPPA, the work of each animator is precious and you have to be passionate to do this job.
And besides, they did a good job for the time they had.
However thank MAPPA for this season will only encourage them to give even more close deadlines to them.",2021-03-03T16:09:00+00:00,5
"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSWell I'm gonna get roasted for this but here we go.I loved seasons 1-3 of AOT, they had something not many other anime could do despite multiple attempts to do so. Problem with this season is that it looses much of that. 1. Sound:While the soundtrack isn't horrible it's a far cry from the infamous music made by Linked Horizon. From the OP to the several themes in the fighting scenes.2. Art: While AOT wasn't THE most beautiful anime out there, it certainly did the job. I'm not gonna be someone who does nothing but complain about the animation and art butit should be said that it was not up to standard for an anime said to have revolutionized the animation sphere.

3. The characters:
By far the one I am most dissapointed in. This will contain slight spoilers, but I don't think they matter that much.
Basically every member of the team has changed, while it's understandable due to the time skip and the work they've been doing I cannot for the life of me get to like everyone's new personality. Certainly some are still good and some even improved, many just feel like your typical anime soldier now. I won't even talk about Eren but I'm not that big a fan of him either. On that topic, only 3 of the original gang actually gets screentime anymore. Eren, Mikasa, Jean, Hange sometimes pops up, but then again she only pops up to further the plot. Armin shows up sometimes, but I am quite sure he has less lines then frickin Connie in Season 1.

And the new characters, I want to focus on one of them in particular: Gabi.
I was very excited to when I heard new characters were coming, and oh boy was I disapointed. None but a few have any sort of development. It's really fixed into 3 groups, the ELDIANS COME FROM HELL group/ELDIAN EMPIRE SHALL RULE ONCE AGAIN group (aka the extremist), the soldier group (who are nothing but soldiers), and the moderate group. Of these 3 groups, the only one that deserves to be talked about in a good way is the moderate group. They unlike the soldier and extremist group actually feel like human beings, story wise the extremist group makes sense. That does not mean it's okay to just show them off every few minutes/episodes (a certain extremist is a MC) for the balls of it.
I'll be fair here and I will admit that story wise all the groups make sense, and I do understand they are needed to further the story. It's the way they implimented them that just hurts my eyes, in the last episodes that has come out (11) even more throw away characters are introduced. One an Eren rip off and one a Mikasa rip off, did they actually run out of Idea's?

Well I'm prepared to get roasted and hate mail for this, but this is my honest opinion and I think at least some people agree with me.",2021-02-21T14:25:00+00:00,6
"StoryThe story is great, i like how the story become morality dillema, when you have to choose a side, but both of them has a bad and good morality reason. that's why it caused war in the community, because neither of them are wrong or right. so yeah, it's tremblingArtPut MAPPA timeline aside, but the CGI titan is just horrible, suprisingly horrible.i hate CGI anime in the first place so almost all CGI anime is bad in my eyes. but when it comes to the hand drawn scene, actually MAPPA did a really good job at it. SoundIt's actually good, but not that majestic, ithink WIT do better in the sound section, where they know where to put majestic soundtrack.

Still the same as the previous season, so not much to tell here

If you can forget about how terrible the CGI is, it's enjoyable actually

"I'm not the biggest fan of Mappa's adaptation of S4, but AoT as a whole deserves to dethrone the highly overrated FMAB. I can't remember the last time I watched a mainstream anime where I was genuinely curious about what was gonna happen instead of 'good guy remembers the power of friendship and activates anime powers and punches ancient evil in the face'. AoT, as a story, is everything anime should strive to be and more. Undoubtedly the Greatest of All Time as of the writing of this review. It'll be a long time before any other story can outdo AoT, the only possibly contenderI can think of being Berserk if Miura ever decides to finish it.",2021-01-28T06:06:00+00:00,10
"Here we are at the finale of an incredible show that took years in the making. As far as the story is concerned, the AOT universe is a developed story that has taken seasons to develop into what it is today. Just like the previous seasons, season 4 is no exception regarding its world. As far as Art is concerned, Mappa is doing any excellent job creating scenes. Due to timing reasons, CGI is heavily used for titans however I personally believe it blends quite well with the landscapes and make fights look more fluid.For soundtracks, AOT is notorious for creating recognizable soundtracks and thisseason is no different. Easy 10/10.

Character development this season is brilliant and you find yourself loving characters you previously despised, or vice versa. 

Overall, a very complete season and I can't wait to see what else the season holds.",2021-01-24T20:29:00+00:00,10
"What was a good mindless action packed show surrounded by mystery and a sense of dread regarding the unknown evolved into a complete convoluted mess of increasingly confusing proportions. I feel like I wasted my time trying to find something interesting in what turned out to be the author's desperation to piece things together while trying to keep up with the series' hype and popularity rather than trying to tell a good story. Although one thing did remain consistent, and it was the excessive use of convenient plot twists to turn the story however which way desirable. This makes it painfully obvious each and everytime it occurs that the writer does not have any foresight on how to progress the story and is making it up as he goes along based on the feedback he receives from the series' fanbase.",2021-09-16T04:42:00+00:00,3

"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ATTACK ON TITAN AND BAD LANGUAGE!This review is going to be a bit different for me. How I usually do things is I write a single review of all the seasons of an anime up to the point that I am done with it (that includes after dropping it as well), but even though I am not done watching Attack on Titan, there is a lot to say with regards to this particular season that I don't think a lot of people are pointing out that I need to get off my chest.Also, keep in mind that I plan ondoing a review of all Attack on Titan seasons once the show has ended, this is more like a precursor or prologue to that review when it comes out because I won't be able to highlight many of these issues that need to be addressed in a full review while keeping it concise and coherent.

The only major flaw that is highlighted by others above all else is the poor CGI and while I agree that it is a noticeable flaw, I found that people were get so caught up on one rather innocuous element that they may not have bothered to think about whether or not the show had far more egregious problems outside of the artistic side of production. Some people even say that the CGI is the ONLY major flaw of the season and in this review, I'd like to point out why that is not the case... but before moving on to the negatives, I want to highlight the merits of this season.

THE GOOD:

The creator of Attack on Titan has always been good at writing really tense, over-the-top action sequences as well as choosing the right moments to have them throughout the story. It’s no different here, but because of the slow boil approach the season took to building up the story, the battles are used sparingly and only when necessary, which is great! The main battle of the season, while it has its flaws from both a writing and an animation standpoint, is heart-pounding and exhilarating to watch. The moment when we saw Armin’s Colossal Titan form for the first time was my particular favorite moment of not just the battle, but the season. The Colossal Titan has also never looked better.

There is a lot of subtlety that went into writing this season that I appreciated. I remember when watching Season 3 Part 2 thinking that choosing Armin over Erwin, while a decision that makes sense emotionally for Levi's character, was a major strategic blunder on his part, and the consequences of that decision are clearly not ignored in this season. That doesn't mean it was badly written, quite the opposite; it totally made sense for Levi's character and set up potential problems later down the line.

Ever since Erwin's departure from the show, the scout's have split up into factions it seems with certain members going rogue and making very questionable moral decisions in the aftermath of the previous Battle. Eren's attack on Marley is one example, and the situation of an all out race war is rapidly approaching a point of no return that nobody in the scout regiment wants to cross. This is largely-- and obviously-- setup for the larger conflict of the next season, and while it is predictable, it does its job very well.

The tension that builds up threatens mutiny and a potential civil war between the scouts and this could have severe repercussions down the line. A lot of the season is set up for many different eventualities in the next one and I'm curious to see how all these plot threads link up and what chaos ensues as a result.

The way the writer developed the events that take place after the previous season and prior to the first episode of Season four was smart. It allows the flow of information to be delivered at precise intervals of time where it can be used flexibly and revealed at the most important moments while avoiding the trap of exposition. It also made time the writer needed to flesh out the new Marleyan characters and Marleyan society while also getting right to the meat of the show, which was necessary for the plot the writer clearly wanted to drive the story towards.

While the CGI is admittedly bad, when the show uses actual 2D art, the show looks pretty damn good. In fact, I believe this is the first time we’ve had a 2D Colossal Titan, which looks better than ever. The backgrounds are well drawn and the characters are clearly realized. I think some of the people criticizing MAPPA haven't seen any of their other shows, but MAPPA is known for creating some awesome shows with spectacular artwork (see Dororo, Banana Fish, and Jujutsu Kaisen). This isn't a studio that makes the same mediocrity you see over and over again.

The sound and musical quality overall is really good, as per every season of Attack on Titan. There is very little to talk about here as it's all largely carried over from the previous seasons. The voice acting is solid, the action is tense, and the emotional impact it carries is heavy, to say the least.

There are other positive elements that are carried over from the previous season, but most of it is all very well known, and I plan on discussing that in detail when I do my review of the entire Attack on Titan series once the show has officially ended. So for now, that's where I'll end this part of the review.

THE BAD:

The biggest drawback of the season by far is the writing. I am truly surprised by how poorly written this season was especially after the last season, which gave us some of the best material in the franchise's history. The story immediately begins with a four-year time skip, which in and of itself, is a major red flag, but more importantly, the show begins by not only throwing a bunch of new characters into an already extremely dynamic and complicated story, but by also developing these ultimately antagonistic characters in a span of four episodes before actually continuing to get to the meat of the story.

When I first saw these first four episodes, I mistakenly thought the story was being rushed because I assumed that this was the last we'd get of AoT, and with only 12 episodes left, I was concerned they'd wrap the story up way too quickly in the same manner that occured with the second season of The Promised Neverland, but the problem is quite the opposite. The story takes a slow-boil approach to develop characters that the writer very clearly wants the audience to connect with. This ultimately fails and contrasts badly with the place the previous season left off.

This leads us to the first, and probably biggest, major blunder of the writing: Remember, one of the most vital elements to both Attack on Titan’s success and quality of storytelling, since the very first season, has always been it’s portrayal of intelligent, practical strategic military action. It’s been a driving force for the shows rising action and most of its major battles and political conflicts. The writer’s obvious understanding of decent military strategy is what made the show special and it’s a huge reason I fell in love with the series. Nowhere in this season is this element present. I will elaborate:

In the span of four years, the Marleyans have completely failed to plan a second wave of attacks on Paradis Island. They have TWO officers with actual, actionable intelligent on not only the enemy’s home turf and the layout of the land, but Reiner also knows on a personal level how the enemy thinks. He lived amongst them, befriended them, and absorbed their culture and served under their military ranks. He knows how the scout regiment operates, THAT the scouts will almost certainly be the military force they'll be fighting against in the next battle, and he knows that Erwin, their greatest and most vital military asset, is likely dead, which gives them a very distinct strategic advantage.

Any officer in any military with even the most basic understanding of military strategy would know what to do next in this situation: plan your second attack, gather your armies and all the titans under your command, make sure the attack takes place on the enemy’s home turf, surround the enemy and strike first before they have a chance to fully recuperate, recover their strength, and make their way across the sea and gather their own intelligence on your territory and your forces for their own attack. If the Marleyans had sent its army and it's human titans into battle after a year of planning, it is likely they would have not only won most, if not all, the major battles, but finished off the Paradis survivors and won the war. This was the obvious move to make, but that would have been too inconvenient so it was ignored.

The biggest factor in deciding which side loses a war is not how smart you are compared to the enemy, it's not how strong you are compared to the enemy, or even necessarily how many soldiers you have in your army or what kind of weapons you use. It's what kind of information you have and are able to gather on your enemies forces and your own. You can fight an enemy with nothing but sticks and stones and even if they are using guns against you, if you have all the information and the enemy has none, your side will almost always win. Even if Reiner hadn't survived, Zeke knows the Paradis landscape well AND he fought a couple battles against the scouts. He knows their most important players, who their best soldiers are, and witnessed some of their battle tactics firsthand. This is far more than anything the scouts have, but now that the scouts have been to Marley, both sides have a relatively equal chance to win.

By failing to act in the span of four butt-fucking years, Marley has given the enemy ample amounts of time needed for them to recover, gather their strength, cross the sea, and infiltrate not only the civilian population of Marley, but also their own military ranks and make their plan of attack without anyone growing wise to it. Hell, the Marleyans haven't even seemed to have planned or prepared an invasion strategy at all much less a defensive countermeasure in the event of foreign invasion. This all leads up to a devastating surprise attack in the heart of Marleyan civilization that claims the lives of several of its leaders, civilians, and one of its human Titans who's ability now rests in the hands of the enemy. This oversight is shockingly careless and utterly moronic, and coming from a show built upon smart military strategy, it's almost unheard of. In one single battle, the Eldians now have the upper hand and the consequences of the battle will likely lead to a massive war that will be disastrous for both sides. Nearly all the tension that had built up carrying over from the previous season and building up to the battle is lost as a result because we now know that the scouts are fighting an enemy that clearly is less intelligent, underestimates their enemies, and has far inferior long-term strategic planning.

Here’s a question: why should I be invested in a war when the bad guys are idiots and will clearly lose especially since, now that we know the Titans aren’t even a practical threat anymore, there’s no real concern for the survival of the entire human race?

The newly introduced characters are awful, and I mean Last of Us Part II awful. The leader of the Marleyans army, Willy Tybur, is the idiot who failed to plan a second attack on Paradis Island and allowed the scouts to infiltrate their ranks, and make their attack on the city he's supposed to protect. He's one of the first to die in Eren's attack and if you took him out of the story, very little would change. His younger sister, is secretly the War Hammer titan. Eren kills her and takes her titan ability. That's about all there is to her character. Falco is a weak-willed, timid boy who dreams of becoming the next armored titan, but is hopelessly smitten by Gabby, one of the other titan candidates because she's super masculine, strong-willed, direct, and somewhat attractive. She overpowers his decisions and he lets her because he can't help himself.

Speaking of Gabby, she is the worst of the new characters. She is notoriously despised by many people within the AoT community, including the people that vigorously defend the season's drawbacks. Her entire character is based upon girl power. She is more active than her male counterparts. She’s stronger than her male counterparts. And she really, really HATES the ""Devils of Paradis."" She is supposed to serve as a foil to Eren and give us a stark contrast to the way he behaved in the earlier seasons as well as how he is behaving now, but the problem is that a) Eren's anger was directed, rightfully and solely, at the Titans (whom were little more than mindless animals) that invaded and destroyed his home, and b) Gabby's anger is clearly based upon reliably false, propagandistic information about a nation she knows little to nothing about. The only thing this gets across is that both Gabby and Eren were acting childish, which is something that everyone already knew, so the concept falls flat on its face. It's no wonder Gabby is as despised as she is and this leads us naturally to another major blunder with the writing.

SPOILER ALERT: Gabby kills Sasha. Now, on the surface, this would appear to be a good thing. Killing off a major, beloved character that has been with us since nearly the beginning of the show in such a sudden manner would suggest that any character can perish just as easily and it keeps the audience on the edge of their seats worrying about who could die next. I don't have a problem with the fact that Sasha died or even that gabby did the deed. I have a problem with how she died because it should not have happened to begin with. Gabby was only able to kill Sasha because she commandeered a dead scout's VME, used it to board their blimp, roll onto the ship, and fire the killing shot before anyone could stop her and without any resistance whatsoever. They literally leave the door wide open open for her. Even if the scouts weren’t worried about someone boarding, they should have been worried about a stray shot from a rifle potentially rinding it’s way through the massive open door, ricocheting, and hitting someone by mistake. They should have sealed the opening as soon as they started to make their retreat. The scouts are not stupid, so why was this mistake present?

Going back to my “Last of Us Part II” reference, this is reminiscent of a very infamous death scene from the game as well. I won’t say what in case of spoilers, but they share the same problem. It’s not quite as bad in Attack on Titan though.

On top of that, nobody was guarding the entrance to the airship and even when Jean Kirstein actually hears the sound of Gabby approaching, instead of taking the initiative to check it out himself, he instead asks everyone else, who were partying, if they heard the sound themselves. Jean, of all the characters in the show, would have almost certainly checked to make sure everything was on the up and up. This is one example of characters not acting like they would normally in previous seasons.

I don't know if this was in the manga or if it was the anime making stuff up, but it's very clear that whoever authored the scene wrote himself into a corner and had to make up circumstances against the intelligence and behavioral patterns of his own characters to create the moment he desired, which is the death of a beloved main character. The new characters are given more time to develop than the old characters, and while that's absolutely necessary for the story being told right now, the new characters pale in comparison with the old so we spend all this time with characters that a lot of us ultimately didn’t like. It would have been better to just focus on developing Reiner, Zeke, and introducing the ranking military leaders of the Marleyans planning and unleashing an invasion of Paradis instead.

Speaking of Reiner, his character has been ruined. This, however, was not surprising to me since his character has been descending a slow downhill spiral since he revealed who and what he was to Eren in the second season, but after this season, it's almost reached the point of no return. Reiner, originally, was a badass brute of a fighter who many of the scouts looked up to as both a leader, a soldier, and something of an older brother. He was the alpha male of the tribe and a rock for others to cling onto, and his betrayal of the scouts, though the reveal left a lot to be desired, was a major turning point for the show and a huge blow to the scouts morale. Imagine if the scouts had to fight Reiner at his best; the brute, the warrior, the cold, badass soldier we know and love. How incredible would that have been!

Reiner's character has since devolved from the strong, well-rounded, but naive alpha male soldier into a weak-minded, PTSD-induced, delusional shell of a man who can't even kill his enemy to save his own people even when said enemy is sitting right in front of him. I am, of course, referring to Eren who, in this season, makes a similarly foolhardy decision to reveal himself to Reiner as he is about to make an attack on Marley just to rub it in his face. During this precipice, Reiner, instead of immediately attacking Eren before he can transform and initiate his attack properly, falls on his knees and cries like a wimp. I completely understand that he's suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, but Eren is about to put the lives of his friends, his family, Falco, and his countrymen at risk and he does NOTHING to stop it! He doesn't even try! This is a sharp departure from the direct, quick-to-act badass that Reiner was supposed to be and should have always been. In fact, it's like I'm watching a completely different character. He’s entirely unrecognizable. Even in the previous season, Reiner would have acted differently.

At this point, any chance at Reiner becoming the detestable, but sympathetic treasonous, piece of shit scumbag that audiences might desperately want to see turn away from the dark side and rejoin the light as much as they’d want to see someone put a bullet in his head and witness his stinking carcass buried six feet under, is lost.

There are several other writing problems present. Eren escapes from a scout-regiment guarded prison too easily (nice to see the scouts becoming more and more ineffective as time goes on without Erwin's leadership. Good choice, Levi.), Gabby, one of the most stubborn characters we've seen, too quickly and easily accepts the idea that her original perceptions of the Devils might have been mistaken after seeing the damage her people did to one village on Paradis (Is indoctrination that easy to undo? Guess it wasn't that strong to begin with), and apparently Eren's newfound philosophy regarding the particular lack of free will based on genetic predisposition is so fullproof that neither Mikasa nor Armin can come up with a counter argument. Armin is wiser and much more intelligent than Eren, so he should have been able to argue from an opposing viewpoint, but he didn't.

Most of these issues all revolve around the same source: the writer, before creating the events of the season already has an ending in his mind so in order for the story to reach whatever conclusion that will turn out to be, he is pushing-- no, forcing-- the story along in the direction he predetermined even if it means sacrificing the quality of the writing and the development and subsequent quality of the characters/portrayals in the process.

I haven't read the manga past Erwin’s death, therefore I do not know anything about what's going to take place after the fourth season or anything about how the show will end, but I'm seeing signs from this season that the show is going to end badly, and I mean, Game of Thrones Season 8 badly. Right now, Eren has become the villain and is planning to commit genocide. To what extent? I don't know, but based on the way the season is written SO FAR, it seems to me the plot is moving in that direction and that Eren might actually succeed in the end. I'm praying that this is not the case, but I'm nervous about what the next season will bring.

Anything that has been said about the CGI in this show has already been said a million times before, so I won't say much. Yes, it's bad and the action sequences in which the CGI is largely used suffer tremendously as a result. MAPPA was rushed to get the season out and this is what we got, so it's not surprising, but don't mistake that for a defense. MAPPA should have spent more time on the season to get the animation done properly, but they didn't. I've seen the many arguments used by fans to defend the CGI; none of them should be taken seriously. People rightfully shafted One Punch Man Season 2 for the downgrade in the quality of art, and Attack On Titan: Season 4 should be similarly shafted as well. Anyone giving this season a perfect score of a 10/10, or even an 8 or 9, is either being subjective (which is perfectly fine) or is lying to themselves because they want to believe that after S3P2, the show will only get better and better when it's very clearly getting worse.

The season has the worst opening in the series' history. It's a pretty minor offense admittedly, and it's not particularly bad either, but it's noticeable considering every other opening sequence the series has had leading up to this one has been phenomenal thus far.

Keep in mind, just because I didn't like this season, doesn't mean I think the show overall is bad. Even if the actual final season of attack on titan ends up being the worst season ever, the show is still heading towards a 7 or an 8 out of 10 overall. When the final seasons finishes up, I plan on revisiting this review to see what changes and I'll make my final Attack on Titan review, I just wanted to point out that this season has flaws, many flaws that people are overlooking with the writing in particular and I think it's because most people want to maintain the belief that Attack on Titan is always going to be amazing and that it's getting better and better with every new season. Even if you don't agree with me, I hope you can understand where some of the criticism might be coming from and why so many people aren't a fan of the season.

CONCLUSION:

Attack on Titan: The Not-so-Final Season is easily the WORST season of Attack on Titan ever. People don't want to acknowledge the season's flaws because there was so much hype surrounding this season that I think many people are still in denial, but I am also noticing that people are starting to wake up to the fact and are reconsidering their original opinions of the season.

A once masterfully crafted series based on intelligent and precise military strategic action and the survival of the human species against an overwhelming enemy has devolved into a philosophical slog about a race war between politically opposed nations and the cycle of violence. The story went from amazing to bad in the span of a couple episodes, the characters have been shafted and dumbed-down to make way for the story the author truly desires to tell, the CGI ruins the immersion for most of the battles, and the plot has become so convoluted that the plotholes are starting to pile up.

I had originally given the show a final score or 5/10, but upon revisiting the show, thinking about it, and really weighing the pros and cons in order to write this review, overall, the Not-so-Final season of Attack on Titan gets a 4/10. It's subpar mediocrity compared to what came before and as a huge fan of the show, I'm very disappointed by the drop in quality and the direction the series decided to take. I hope the next season will learn from the mistakes of the previous and that the studio and writers can change the direction of this sinking ship before it crashes and burns.

"This is an overall disappointing season, despite the solid effort by the studio.I am unsure whether the actual story is to blame, or the studio.- Story & pacing: This is the primary let down of this season. It is simply not good.The author is trying to explore deeper themes of xenophobia & nationalism by turning AOT into a sort of procedural drama, with massive exposition dumps. The problem is that at the core, it does not work. The pacing and story feel overly convoluted, with little actually happening, rather than a tightly packed epic. You could sum it up with 90% of the season beingtalking in rooms. When AOT was more of a life &amp; death high octane situation with a relatively simple story in S1-3, it actually worked and escalated to a magnificent climax. Instead with S4, the feeling is like a James Bond who just jumped through various explosions &amp; buildings to end up in a court room talking about some conspiracies. It is just a sheer failure of pacing and narrative. Keeping in mind I do not dislike the themes evoked, it is just executed badly.

- Art &amp; Design: While the art can be beautiful and is certainly masterfully done, the characters just don't look as good as in S1-3, and some look actually horrific. The characters also look different physically in height and look, as if they morphed into something different between seasons. Mikasa's look is especially jarring. I was simply taken aback in a bad way by the new look of the series. 

- Final conclusion: So from S1-S3 and the high octane emotional ride of this anime, we go into a dry slow methodical &amp; dark, procedural S4. It's no longer about riding through forests with giants ripping people apart and entire cities getting assaulted, it's rather about discussing politics, things happening off screen or very fast. I do not blame the studio which I feel did an amazing job, but at the core, it feels lacklustre and frustrating. It's the classic case of bad design, when you have a complex great story, but fail at telling it excitingly on screen because you're just dumping exposition dialogue all over the place, which is a big no in cinema. Let us hope that part 2 (2022) will understand the problems and go back to norms.",2021-04-06T06:56:00+00:00,6
"So season 4, how can I explain this. It is freaking mind blowing, the way the show took such a deeper and darker turn really surprised me, but this change was executed amazingly.Plot: In the first 3 seasons Attack On Titan was about killing the titans outside of the walls, and that plot was really original because there hadn't been any anime like it, not only that the details and the way Iseyama developed the plot made Attack On Titan so interesting, but this season the plot was by far one of the best plots in all of animanga. In season 4 the plot reallychanged and it focused on the humans in Attack On Titan, season 4 focused on deep topics like freedom, war, good and evil, and racism. The relationship between Marley and Eldia directly relates to how Jews were being treated by the Nazi's too. 

Instead of focusing on the scouts Iseyama decided to focus on the outside world. It allowed us to view Eldia from a different point of view, we get to learn from the perspective of the main antagonists of the first 3 seasons (Annie, Reiner, Bertholt, and Zeke) and we learn about how they were forced to do the things they did under the rule of Marley. It allows us to understand what they were going through during their time in Marley and the early years of the Paradis Islands mission. 

Characters: Boy oh boy, I can't wait to get into talking about the characters because Iseyama this sly genius, he really just blew my mind. (I used the characters that @Trump used but this is my own personal analysis of them.)

Eren Jaeger: Eren in season 1-3 was that typical revenge shounen protagonist that wanted to avenge his mothers death. To be fair I wasn't a big fan of Eren that much, I thought that he was really cliche, but Iseyama man he made me shut my mouth in season 4. Eren development as a character is insane and he is now arguably one of the best animanga protagonist-antagonist. In season 4 Eren decides to become the devil. Eren realizes in order to obtain the thing he always yearned for which is freedom, he has to become the devil and do bad things. I don't agree with his actions, but Eren ideals are perfect which makes him such a complex character and his development is amazing.

Gabi: Gabi gets a lot of hate, but personally I love her character, Gabi is a victim of false news and political propaganda. Even though she is Eldian herself based off the news she was fed as she was growing up, she views her own kind as devils. Throughout her entire life she has been manipulated by the countries she lives in into believing that Eldians are reincarnation of the devils. Gabi shows no sympathy toward Eldians and will kill them without hesitating just to prove to anyone else she is a worthy warrior candidate. We can start to see Gabi develop as a character when she comes in contact with the girl that Sasha saved, I love what Iseyama did there.

Reiner: Iseyama, I am begging you. Just let Reiner die, he has been suffering, please let him die. Reiner is arguably one of the best written characters in Attack On Titan, Reiner is the embodiment of a modern day soldier. Reiner as a young boy was a nobody that wasn't even supposed to go to the mission at Paradis. As a kid Reiner wanted to show everyone that he was a true warrior he was blinded by the belief of becoming a hero of his country and when he came back you could see that it took a mental toll on him. Reiner comes back suicidal because he wants to atone for his sins, but at the same time he is conflicted because he has lost his will to live, but he wants to protect his hometown. I love what Iseyama did with Reiner.

Zeke: I don't forgive Zeke because he caused the death of my favorite character Erwin Smith, but I feel bad for him. All Zeke wanted was a normal childhood where he was loved by his parents, but instead his father treated Zeke as a tool and forced his beliefs on Zeke. Zeke claims that Eren is brainwashed by his father, but in truth Zeke is envious that his father treated Eren with love and care, while Zeke was just a mere tool for restoring Eldia. It allows us to really understand Zeke's motives, and it allows us to show sympathy toward Zeke.

In conclusion Season 4 was just a masterpiece, I read the manga so I know what happens, but Season 4 Part 2 will be even better. Iseyama really blew my mind with this, I don't care about the animation because MAPPA only had 6-8 to animate, but dang this season was amazing. Attack On Titan will go down as one of the best anime ever created.",2021-04-01T09:03:00+00:00,10
"Shingeki no Kyojin, as known as Attack on Titan is an anime that everyone has seen at least 1 time and is very popular, well received and praised until today.This is one of the best anime shounen that come to existence.I always was a big fan of this anime series since the first time I saw it years ago.I waited so long for this final season to arrive and when it did I followed the season week after week. And now I have to say that I'm kinda dissapointed...The Final Season of Shingeki no Kyojin is overrated and overhyped.It doesn't mean that it is bador anything like that but it's not a masterpiece or really great as many people are saying and reinforcing to death.
Here I will explain why I think this season was not so good as it should be.

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!!! Be aware of that.

Story 7/10:

After 4 years have passed since the resumption of the Shiganshina district, we are now seeing the war between Marley and Mid-East Allied Forces.
The battle is finally over and the side that emerged victorious is Marley.
They are preparing new candidates to become the holders of the titan powers in Marley’s possession because of the end of Zeke and Reiner's 13-year tenure as the Bestial and Armored Titans. While some people of other countries are gathering there for an event to take place.

The plot of this fourth season is interesting but the narrative's structure is a mess.
First we see all the things that happen pos time-skip at once and only after the conclusion of the arc that we discouver the motivations that Eren had to left and attack at the declaration of War of Willy's Tybur.
Why should I care about this explosive conflict between Marley and the Eldians on the Paradis Island if all the things that brought them to this point in the first place were presented in a flashback after the arc of invasion? This doesn't make sense.
If I'm supposed to get attached to the history then make it that the things that made all this war happen in the first place are constructed step by step before the conflict finally explodes with those people that goes against each other.
The way that was built up is the reason that I find it unimpressive.

Another thing that I think it is a problem is the poor utilization and very few appearances of the pure titans.
Do you remember when they were dangerous, when they represented a constant fear and generated a sense of chaos, panic and insecurity? Not anymore! Why?
Because they never attack or appear at all, only when it is extremely convenient or necessary for the plot like in the forest arc that has the Levi vs Zeke battle.
Zeke invoked them by using the ability of his titan's power to create his own army of Titans. It's okay that he can do that because we saw it before on other situation.

I just think that the main reason why this show was unique and extraordinary once now is long gone. At least for me.
Their presence was natural and really important on the AOT's world and universe as a whole as well and now they're just a tool to be used sometimes (when they appear). Lame.
Now it is just a political conflict with war between nations without any Titans. :)

What about the Titan shifters? Oh, man!
I thought they were so strong and equally important but apparently they are not.
The majority of them are just useless and powerless against Eren.
Eren is invencibly. Do you know that he already has the power and abilitys of 3 titans?
After the time-skip he had a battle with the Warhammer Titan that was apparently far stronger that his titan's form and he actually winned the combat with the help of Mikasa.
One more time he wins a fight with in stupid way. 
He had help to win that combat otherwise he would be dead by that point. 
The only one that is actually a good and impressive Titan shifter is Zeke.
Reiner? He is a joke. Whenever he is fighting you know he will lose.
He's the armored titan but can't receive any damage whatsoever that he goes down 100%. Awesome! Always being destroyed in his fights. SUPER. \o/
What can we say about Annie that was literally frozen since season 1 after the final fight with Eren and never came back? Wonderful!
Why Isayama would have to develop or utilize properly her in any creative or productive way when he can pretend that she doesn't exist for many years? hahaha
Galliard is a guy that couldn't do nothing because he doesn't have any importance whatsoever, he will do anything against Eren even if he have some help of other Titan shifter. Do you know why? 
Because Eren is the protagonist and he will always destroy him. 
Jaw, Armored and Warhammer Titans were only there on the story to be defeated by Eren with virtually 0 effort. They were used as plot devices more than anything else. 
Colossus Titan almost never appear. Don't wait for more transformations of Armin.
He once transformed at the invasion on Marley's arc and will transform only one more time next the end and that's it. ;D
I could spend all the day talking about the bad use of them by the author.
This is a shame. I would really like to see them being more important on the series.

Anyway, the story is good more for the connection established by the construction of the plot previously on the first seasons.
And for that I give here just a 7 out of 10.

Art - Animation 6/10:

Oh my God, I will have to be honest and tell the truth instead of those people that are pretending this part of the anime is amazing. It is not. Seriously.
The animation quality dropped so much compared to what we had on season 1-3.
Many scenes that you see the characters they are being static with few movements when they walking/ running or even fighting. 
The characters actions are limited and the art design is also inconsistent. Characters that look good in one scene or episode on another moment doesn't. 
The fight scenes are boring as fuck to watch.
Eren vs Warhammer on the trailer was SO MUCH BETTER that is so depressing to see them clashing on the anime. Those 3D models of them were crappy. Real trash.
The 2D Titan shifters were infinitely better looking than those new 3D Titans.
Levi vs Zeke was okay, but on the manga was way more intense and imersive.
On the previous seasons we had dinamic movements with fluid scenes of the DMT being used by the soldiers tropes, we had Annie vs Eren that was epic, we had top tier animation fights just like Levi vs Zeke (more like one-side fight but okay haha), we had the insane revelation of Bertholdt and Reiner as being respectively Colossus and Armored titan.
Hell, even those cool action scenes of Levi facing Kenny and the gang on the streets were absolutely crazy.
On this season we only have one or two scenes, three at max, that are great and very well animated on the episodes: Declaration of War, Sasha's Death and Zeke's past were 10/10.
Anything else are average of below that...sad but true.

Sound 4/10:

The OST's that are used on this Final Season are less impactful than ever.
I barely can even remember a moment when a song was playing that made it so remarkable as the many epic scenes with GOD tier soundtrack that we had before.
The poor mix of them doesn't help either.
Some moments we listen to OST's that felt totally out of place.
The new opening has an okay music but nothing compared to classic openings like:
Guren no Yumiya, Sasageyou and the underrated Jiyuu no Tsubasa.
The song of the season 3 part 2 opening also smash this new one, too.
The only thing that I found it amazing is the song of the ending, very good.

For being only decent and average at best that I give here a 4 of 10.

Character 7/10:
This is one of the best parts of the anime series but is not very good.
There are so many interesting and important characters like Armin, Hange, Zeke, Levi, Falco, Gabi; etc. I didn't mention the edgy lord MC cause I hate him.
The problem of AOT is that the characters doesn't get much development as they could receive and when they are developed we don't know how, when or what happened that made them change. Mikasa never gets any good treatment.
She is pretty much the same she always was. This is clear as the day when we saw her stopping Armin that was trying to go against Eren on their reunion.
That shit pissed me off. Armin is now someone who almost never wants to fight or plan an surprise attack on his enemies or make something tactically genius (like he constatly did before) and instead of those things he only wants to talk and to choose diplomatic solutions. I like him a lot, I always did, but I miss him being more active.
Eren...what can I say about this motherfucker? He is a completely different character now.
We didn't see him changing with our own eyes on the actual history itself, he changed off-screen on the time-skip process. We see some points here and there that may helped him to get to what he is now but only through flashbacks. His development is so sudden and radical that is almost unbelievable. Seems forced sometimes.
He choosed to left and disapear of Paradis Island, infiltrate the enemy's nation by himself, without any help and in the last hour he invited everybody for his rescue and backup for when he would being attack all the people there were present at the declaration of war.
He killed innocent people. He killed civilians that were Eldians slaves. 
And he couldn't care less about what he did.
If Eren demonstrated any emotion or stop at any time whatsoever to think about his actions I think I could sympathize more with him. I know, war is war, right?
True but doesn't mean that when he is doing something I have to praise or accept anyway.
He didn't had a good development.
More than 3 seasons with almost 60 episodes and 10 years going by so he could grow up and do anything but cry and scream all the time. 
But whatever, enough of talking about him.
Other characters like Connie, Sasha (RIP), Mikasa, Historia, Pieck, Galliard; etc doesn't get any good screen time to be developed.

Enjoyment 6/10:

It was okay for the most part but that's it.
Not epic or incredible anymore. I lost almost all the interest on this series.
The great old but gold times when I finished an arc or a season and get 100% hyped to continue watching is beyond gone.
I'm not even sad that this Final Season of the anime has finished, it's actually a relief that I will not have to watch this anime for a while.
If I would describe my enjoyment with this Final Season of AOT with one phrase:
""Worth it for being Shingeki no Kyojin, but if it was another anime with the same history and some ajusted things, would be a mediocre show.""

Overall 6/10:
I would give at least an 8 or 7 but I actually give a 6.
It's an okay season, good at best. But not as good as anything that came before.
Sorry but that's what I think. I'm dissapointed with this season.
I'm not hyped as I was anymore and only thinking about AOT makes me sad.

If you are a fan of the series is a must watch.
If you are not than it's better to watch other anime instead.",2021-03-28T22:25:00+00:00,6
"Alright, my ratings may seem overly critical. It's just that there are too many people giving this a ten when it's NOT. I'm really sick of people praising Attack On Titan like this is the second coming of Christ. I'm not saying it's a bad anime, just that it has flaws and it greatly affected my ability to enjoy the show. Keep in mind I only watched till episode 6 of this season. My eyes couldn't bear the pain of how ugly this anime was. But I did start reading the manga where season 3 left off. also I'm going to keep this as spoilerfree as possible so I might not include some things since they include spoilers. 

Story: 9
The story is very creative. It's like a fresh breath of air. The setting and the atmosphere the show creates is very well done. It's a story where we find out the truth with the characters. I don't have much to say considering I don't have many criticisms of the story besides the occasional asspulls or parts that just didn't make any sense but I'd say they had more of those in the previous seasons.

Art: 6
This is the main reason I stopped watching the newest season. MAPPA’s cgi is just so unpleasant to look at that I didn't even want to watch anymore. The titan fights are the most important parts in the animation. It's what stays in your mind. It's the part that people will watch the animation for, since it's not the same on paper. I really dislike cgi personally. It takes you out of the world since you have this object sticking out like a sore thumb, especially since it moves and looks completely different from everything else. Another thing is the wonky anatomy that comes every time Eren is shirtless. He looks like he has a hunchback… you don't see this often but it always happens at the crucial moments. An example when Eren puts on his jacket… or when Eren looks into the mirror and says “fight”. Besides that I would say the art is nice. They do a really good job and lighting, shading and backgrounds which makes the overall picture pleasing to look at. If you don't mind cgi or the occasional thought of “why does he look off?” I'm sure the anime will be enjoyable for you.

Sound: 7
The sound was good. Had good music for the impactful moments and such. Op was good as well.

Characters: 4
This is my main problem with Attack On Titan. I really believe that characters matter more than the story because why should I care about the story if I don't care about the characters. The characters drive the story forward so how am I supposed to enjoy a story where the people driving the story forward don't matter to me? You can't. And I feel like this is less of a personal thing because a lot of these characters are so undeveloped or are just badly written. The side characters are so flat and are hardly relatable or likeable and are mostly defined by one or two traits so I could care less what could happen to them, but who cares right? They're SIDE characters so let's look at the MAIN characters. Eren is really the only character who develops quite a lot. He has reasonable goals and he's easy to sympathize with and take his side (which is expected of a main character). You'd think seeing all the attention and care erens character gets from the author you'd think he's the authors favourite? Wrong. It's Armin. Armin has goals but he isn't very likeable. He's made out to be the “hero” of the story but he doesn't really have much to show for it but for some standard morals.
Something that is really annoying about his character is how he's made out to be this genius and someone who can think on his feet but really he can't at all. Even the plans he sometimes comes up with aren't really that smart. He was made to seem smart in his environment but this is done very poorly and it more seems like everyone is praising him for no reason. Either that or everyone is dogshit stupid. Last one, Mikasa: where do i even start… unlike Armin and Eren she DOESN'T have personal goals so you can't really root for her cause she's working towards nothing. Her whole character just is based around Eren. Whenever she takes action it's because of Eren whenever she has a short term goal it's because of Eren. Eren, Eren, Eren. And some may find this acceptable because of Mikasa's trauma or the fact that she's romantically interested in Eren. Well both of those aren't an excuse. You can still have someone be codependent and not make their whole character about the person they are dependent on. Same goes for the romantic interest. This would be different if she was a side character but she's not. Compared to Eren and Armin she hardly exists and is a waste of screentime. A character I personally think is well written and likeable in this season is Reiner. He isn't inherently the bad guy or good guy. They show a lot of his conflict with himself and his beliefs in this season and his backstory. He's an interesting character and I enjoyed the way his character developed. If you’re going to watch this season for anyone, make it Reiner or Eren. Watching Eren’s machinations unfold was pretty interesting. 


Enjoyment: 6
Overall, I would definitely say Attack On Titan was… time spent.
There were parts of it I really liked and parts that really hindered my ability to say I fully enjoyed this show. Would I recommend this to someone? If they are new to anime, yes :D.",2021-03-02T04:25:00+00:00,7
"This is a short very biased tantrum/review. I'm not a die-hard AoT fan. /some spoilers. FIRST OF ALL TO THOSE WHO ARE HATING AND SENDING DEATH THREATS TO THE VA'S AND STAFFS THAT ARE WORKING TO THEIR BONES TO GIVE US A FORTH SEASON of AOT. FUCK YOU. You have NO rights to do that because ONE, Studio MAPPA is doing their fucking hardest to keep up with the RIDICULOUS deadlines given from above them. TWO, studio MAPPA and their staff/animators/artists/VA's were the ONLY animation company to take up this STRESSFUL and already HIGH STANDARD with HIGH EXPECTATION. Studio MAPPA has done a great jobwith CGI as well. LASTLY, the staffs/people that are working on the final season of AOT are humans, they are burning themselves by working to the bones and not getting any decency from the viewers and audiences watching AOT. WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU HARRASSING THE STAFF WHEN MOST OF YOU ARE PROBABLY WATCHING AOT FROM ILLEGAL SITES TO BEGIN WITH. 

 I understand that we all have different opinions and taste in the art-style or storytelling but please, give the staffs/artists/animators/VA's some empathy and respect. Studio MAPPA and everyone working on the final season of AOT are doing their hardest to deliver already high expectations.

"I usually don't write reviews until I've seen the entire thing, but I just can't help but write this now when I've ""only"" seen 10/16 episodes.Story 6/10:The story itself isn't actually bad, it's actually quite good, if not for one problem, the flashbacks. About half of the episodes have left me with a feeling of ""oooh, I want to see what happens next!"" only to instead feature, almost exclusively, flashbacks to something that could have just been shown before whatever is currently happening chronologically was shown... There is also another more specific problem I have with these flashbacks, but discussing that would be a spoiler,let's just say that it kinda feels like the author (or screenwriters depending on how closely they follow the source) is trying to cheat the system...

Art 8/10:
People seem to complain a bit about the CGI, but it's honestly not bad. Not much to say.

Sound 10/10:
Great music, great voice acting.

Character 7/10:
Like the setting, like the characters, but there isn't anything particularly outstanding.

Enjoyment 5/10:
As discussed with the story, the frequent jumps from ""moving forward"" too ""this happened a while back, but we didn't show it until now!"" just feels awful (and a lot of the time, it doesn't even feel entirely necessary).

Overall 6/10:
The show is good when it is good, and even the flashback episodes I've talked about hating is ""good"" in isolation (mostly), but for the third time, I just can't stand how they suddenly just forgot how the linear progression of time works...",2021-02-14T13:48:00+00:00,6
"I want to start off by saying harassing the animation crew on social media is unacceptable. They are just doing what they had been told to do and I totally appreciate that.I normally wouldn't write a review unless I finish a show but after seeing all of those 10's given by fans and an overall score of 9.17 I felt like I needed to write a review.Art and Animation: 5Because of the little time they had MAPPA chose to animate the titans with CGI, and I don't like it. They feel more like robots rather than titans and it just feels weird. I'm also gettingsick of the slow-motion scenes.

Aside from CGI, there is a general lack of animation as well. Humans barely move and it's usually them standing still and only their mouths moving.

There is also the issue with the character designs. All of the characters look like they have gained some weight since season 3. Noses look pretty ugly as well.

And finally the art this season is inconsistent. The animation can be very smooth in one episode and there could be no animation at all in another episode. If we compare episodes 6 and 7 the difference in animation quality is very obvious.

Story: 9

The rest review after this point will be very positive.

This 4th season is by far the best season storywise. After leaving the walls we went to the other side of the ocean. We saw how our enemies are the same as us.  

I don't want to write any more about the story because I feel like I'm going to spoil something. It's just great and you will enjoy it.

Sound: 10

The voice acting is once again superb. Voice actors and actresses do a great job giving the emotion.

I have never been very fond of the characters of this show. I never felt attached to any of the characters until this season. But now with newly introduced characters - especially Falco- and Eren's character developing I can say I like the characters this season.

Overall: 7

Even though I'm not a fan of the animation it's still Attack on Titan and it's pretty good.

"This has got to be one of, if not the best anime out right now imo. season 4 met all of my expectations in every way. Every Sunday my plans are based around watching the newest episode. This will be in my top 10, hell maybe even top 5 for a VERY long time. The story is so well written that even the first minuets of this anime hold such importance to the plot. I don't think I will find another anime like this for a very long time. And when this anime finishes there will be such a whole in the anime community thatwe can only hope the next gen of anime can fill.",2021-02-08T09:56:00+00:00,10
"If you are caught up to season 3 part 2, I will probably not be spoiling anything except character names and their personalities.I've only joined the attack on titan fandkm back in... 2019? Around January of 2019. I watched AOT dubbed, and rushed through the show, to season 3 part 1. Now, I know, I know. The dubbed for aot isn't that great. But I was a different person back then, and I still think it's a masterpiece, and am watching it subbed now.Back in 2019, I distinctly remember, when I was talking about Attack with someone who liked season 1, I asked them whydid the Armoured and colossal Titan break the walls, when I was still on season 1, and they said it was for fun. 

They haven't watched the show in over half a decade. So they have no idea what is happening now.

Renier... He's an amazing character. Someone I used to hate, for killing his people, was someone I now felt bad for. He just wanted to be a hero to humanity. He's the complete opposite of Eren, honestly. Eren wanted revenge. But Renier, he wanted recognition and love. It made me think, in comparison, how much of an easier life Eren had compared to Renier. Renier's father was a deadbeat, who hated Renier, and wanted nothing to do with him. Eren, however, had a loving mother and father, and they loved him up until their deaths.

Gabi... She's a lot like Eren. She's bratty, arrogant, angry, tiring, etc. Just like Eren was. The difference is the circumstances. I believe, if she was Carla's child, and was raised within the walls, she would turn out exactly like Eren. 

Falco, he's an amazing character. He knows the truth, unlike Gabi, and knows that Marley fully deserves what came to it. However, at the same time, he is saddened by everything that is happening to everyone, and will do what it takes to keep her alive. He kind of reminds me of Armin. He's a genuinely good person, and luckily for him, his hands haven't been tainted by the blood of war. He wouldn't have people's blood on his hands. 

Now, obviously, I can't go into all these characters and say that this is a masterpiece just based on the characters alone. No, everything about this season is masterfully done.

I have seen many complaints about how ""badly animated"" attack on titan is. Honestly, they should see episode 4 of attack on titan season 1. I've watched season 1... 7 times to try to find the ending? It was clear that Wit was running out of time, and needed a massive overhaul for their blue ray release.

However, while there are certainly tweaks they could make for the blue ray release for attack on titan season 4, Mappa has done way better then I ever thought they would. The rotoscopping was masterfully done, and Udo in episode 2 looked like he was rapping, and it looked amazing. It's not Ufotable good, obviously, but then again, ufotable had over a year to make demon slayer, and most of their other series'. Mappa had 6 months to make 16 episodes. Although their are some questionable usages of cgi at times, my jaw was dropping with episode 6, to the point where I didn't even care. Episode 7 was amazingly animated, and really gets you to feel the horror of attack on titan. Episode 8... Amazingly done. Especially at the end.

Osts and sound design are another strong point for the series, even with the weird ass names. Sorry, Sawano, but stop punching your keyboard for the names of your songs. In all seriousness, the osts are top tier. Episode one, and that scream... I'd never felt more enraged then I did at a fictional character. The music in episode 2... Was soft, comforting, and felt... Almost nostalgic. Episode 3 calls back to the past, and we see the story through new eyes, but with the same songs we saw. Episode 4... Is relaxing, and the amazing music that plays creates a comfortable atmosphere. 

One thing I want to mention, is that, somehow, with Mappa, I feel more hungry watching episode 4 of attack on titan season 4, then when I watch the entirety of food wars, which is saying something, since it has literal food within the name. Because there is an atmosphere around the food. Like eating pizza, getting sauce all over your face, laughing, getting ice cream for the first time in your life, etc. It's a very soothing atmosphere. But, by the end of the episode, you could tell, as the ending credits come closer and closer, that peace wasn't permanent, and that's exactly what happened.

Episode 5 was the episode that really detailed what happened with this world, while keeping the three sides to every story that the author of the series, Hajime Isayama, has made clear. There is the Ally's story, the enemy's story, and then, the truth. Propaganda perpetuated by both sides exist to paint the other side as the most evil, but it's usually not that simple. So, when Wily pulled back the curtain, in a metaphorical sense, people are shocked. Eldians and marleyans alike. Which climaxes when 2lives, not 2volt, plays. Honestly, I used to think that YOUSEEBIGGIRL, Renier and Bertholdt's theme, would work better, but then I realized it involved playing over the entire speech, which would take away from the things Wily was saying, and agreed that 2lives was probably the best choice they could have made.

Honestly, this series deserves the praise it gets. Love the series. Don't get why their is 10,000 1 out of 10s, because, in all honesty, this is as close as it gets to a perfect series.",2021-02-07T07:37:00+00:00,10
"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSAttack on Titan has always been one of my favorites and it's also one of the first anime I've ever watched. The moment I've been waiting for has finally arrived and I am absolutely enjoying every single bit of it. My first impressions of Season 4 weren't so very good because of the CGI used in the first episode, but I think it's fine because of the amazing direction, soundtrack and the atmosphere. The animation is improving with each episode, and considering how they had very tight constraints, I can do nothing but to praise them for what they are doing. 1-Starting off with the story as usual for my reviews, it's amazing. The tone, atmosphere and the usual terror of Titans have shifted towards an amazing War theme. I like how Isayama takes inspiration from the events of World War 2. It doesn't feel like we are in the walls now, it feels something big now. So, it starts off with showing us the perspective of the Marleyans. A war has broke out because Marley failed to retrieve the founding Titan. Countries have made weapons that can kill even the armored Titan. The story in my opinion has become morally grey, and I am loving it so far so I will just rate it 10 for now.

2-  Now moving on to the soundtrack, it's absolutely amazing. Ashes on the fire is so good that I am addicted to it. I can't even stop myself once I start listening to it. The Opening theme takes notes from the events of WW2, and showcases the War themes. The violins played in the Opening are fantastic. The ending theme is beautiful as well. My favorite soundtrack from the anime up until now is Mikasa vs Warhammer Titan soundtrack and the main theme which is Ashes on the fire. Another thing I wanted to say is that how perfectly the soundtrack is placed for each moment, like how in the Episode 5 during Tyber's speech. It gives a feeling of terror, anticipation and thrill. 
10/10.

3-  The animation in some parts is jarring like the Eren eating Warhammer Titan moment. Other than that, I could only find two-three scenes where the animations sucked, while the rest was really good given how tight constraints they had. Episode 5 and 8 had the best animation from this season. Moving on to the CGI, it's sometimes bad while sometimes really good. Jaw Titan;s moments don't even feel like CGI at all, and it's the best use of CGI I've ever seen. Reiner's appearance in first episode was great as well, it was noticeable, but it was still blended really well. Beast titan looked good as well. Eren looked awful in Episode 6, but looked good in the previous episode. 

4-  Characters have improved a lot in my opinion. Considering how I absolutely hated Reiner in previous seasons, I am feeling his emotions now. I am sympathizing with him now. I can feel his guilt and why he wants to kill himself so badly. The only reason why he's living now is because of Gabi, Falco and for the protection of other people. Eren was already a badass, and in this season he amplified his hatred for the Marleyans to the maximum level. I think his development was great. 

5-  I'm enjoying the show a lot. Nothing more in this regard. 10/10.",2021-02-04T22:52:00+00:00,10
"a masterpiece. no more to say. the best anime ever done. the music is epic, the story is original and different, the character development it's outstanding (especially eren, jean and reiner after the timeskip), the philosophy about life (pay attention to erwin's speech, more existencialist than albert camus) and, of course, the most important thing to me: the plotwist, i never know what's going to happen next, every twist is calculated and yet unexpected. by far, this is the best anime ever done.the beginning of the show starts a bit confusing for the ones who didnt read the manga, but introduces the other side ofthe story: marley. isayama tries to show the gray-scale morality that exists in this world. in shingeki, nobody is right, nobody is wrong, everybody fights for their ideals and beliefs. the best example is eren: for the eldians is a hero, for the marleyans is a monster. if we had start seeing this magnific story from marley's point of view, eren is a villain, but we started from eldian's, that's why we undertand eren and we support. that's why exists gabi's character, though u all hate her cause she killed a useless character :)
that's why shingeki no kyojin is so good, shows the true human nature, erwin also represents that, he wanted to know the truth and proves that's his father was right, and for that he sacrificed many of his comrades, for a selfish wish.
pd: mappa animation is more faithful and less fanservice. deal with it. and gabi is an awesome character",2021-02-01T15:04:00+00:00,10
"(THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS)I never been this nitpicky in my life, because Attack on Titan is a Masterpiece and should be handled with care but they handled it hastily.I'm manga reader but I rarely read action manga because I would rather watch it instead but this one is an exception due to great story.I always rather watch action anime instead of reading it but I'm a little disappointed about the less animation and the Overuse of CGI. (it would be ok if it uses as a background characters or a 3d Environment)Story 10/10No doubt the best story I've ever watch. Character 10/10Great character Designand great character development specially eren.
Added new characters to the series and flesh them out for the big event, that makes you cry.

Sound 8/10
The sound here are pretty awesome but its a hit or miss for me sometimes.
But Overall great selection of new soundtracks and the remixes of the old classic as well.


2D Art 8/10
I really like the aesthetic for this season, very gritty look, muted color palette 
and less shiny than season 3 but its inconsistent sometimes but the art really blend the season very well.


2D Animation 7/10
I really like the explosions, its pretty dynamic.
And Some Key scenes looks epic but most of its scene are very short and use CGI instead.
But there's some animations that look janky or missing a couple of keyframes.


CGI 8/10
They did great job on this one specially in low light scenes that you can't see the difference unless you pause for a moment.

The CGI is pretty bad if  its zoom in very close seeing the polygons or if its very zoom out the outlines of the CGI are very noticeably horrible and breaks immersion.

Some Very Questionable camera angles that makes the CGI look bad and doesn't blend well.



CGI Animation 6/10

-Titans
Some Pretty janky animation with less impactful to it as if there's no weight to it.
Sometimes the the titan shifters moves around are too fast or too slow.


-Survey Corps
Its great they use some 3D camera angles on the survey corps but they also did for scouts as 3D as well making me feel weird when they are zip zapping around with the titan with no weight as well.


Season 3 have better fluid 3D shots as they use 2D characters and 3D environment together.


Direction 7/10
They add some scene to make it longer but acceptable.

Some impactful scenes are lesser impact due to the soundtrack chosen, or not enough context, specially at the end of some episodes

For example (some spoiler)
Like how less impactful on how Armin explode, they just didn't add more scene on how big of the impact of the explosion is and just straight back to the battlefield where all titans gathered and a pretty lackluster ost that they've used.

At least the aftermath I felt that Armin's emotions.

And also how weird the cart titan bounces between the building with the bad angle they've chosen, it should just run off to the building and just fall straight to the street that would be great.

And Levi vs Monke scene is missing some great panels from the manga.
Or levi  getting close and attacks monke in the first part of the episode that scene with slow motion and just teleports somewhere hiding wait what?

There's more but you get the gist. 

The trailer has better animation, lighting and camera angles and I'm disappointed but its to be expected for this very tight schedule.

Enjoyment 10/10
I still did enjoy it due to the story itself being a masterpiece and all

Overall 10/10
I know that Studio MAPPA don't have enough time but  please give us all the better direction, lighting, camera angles, animations, and 2D glory in the Blur Ray release please lol

I don't know how MAPPA works so maybe they should stop Jujutsu Kaisen for a moment and polish this masterpiece.

I highly recommend you to watch this show as the story very clearly carries it than the negatives, specially if your not too nitpicky about the CGI.

Just don't harass the staff please.",2021-01-27T23:33:00+00:00,10
"THIS IS A MASTER PIECE. People might Rant on MAPPA for the cgi titans but the story is a true master piece.People who think this anime is trash are retarded. STORY- 10I have watched more than 100+ animes and haven't seen such well written story.Every single part of this story is important , If u miss 1 episode , u might not understand some stuff going on in the story. The way isayama wrote this is truly amazing. When i first started watching the show , i thought it was about revenge like most of the animes, but no. The story has reached another height, Emotionally , Pace wise and politically. This story is very relatable to our real life situation. FREEDOM is one of the most important parts of the story and Freedom is what Eren wants for himself and the Paradis island people. The way the story has connections to each and every scene and each scene plays an important role in the story. The other amazing thing is how there are no villans and heroes in this anime. The eldians who lived outside Paradis where brainwashed to believe that the eldians race are devils. They were brain washed because of fear that the rumbling would start. So for them Eren who holds the founding titan power looks bad. And for Eren , The marley people who broke wall and let the titans eat the Paradis people, The marley  looked like villans for Eren. I really can't spoil so i won't say anything else. 

ART- 8 
MAPPA are the new studio and yes they had only 3 - 4 months to animate this season and yes it was rushed. But other than the cgi every thing else is done really well by MAPPA. They should be appreciated instead of insulted. They did really well for this short amount of time they got. And the cgi dosen't look bad on the jaw . cart . War hammered and armored titan. Attack and beast titan was a bit off but other than that , it was amazing.

SOUND-9 
Sound tracks are always amazing in AOT. NO complains.

CHARACTER- 10 
The way each character plays an important role , like the protagonist is just amazing. Each character has their own past and are not ignored. But i have to speak about Eren , the way he went from a wining brat to a completely depressed and mature person is just amazing. After learning the truth about the titans and the outside world and after re gaining the memories of the previous users Eren became a different person. But one thing that he always wanted was freedom. From the start from where he told Hannes that they were like cattle to titans , to now where he is putting away his humanity and getting innocent people involved to attain freedom. He is doing all of this so that his friends and people of Paradis live a peaceful life. 

Enjoyment - 10 
 I really enjoy watching a master piece and an amazing story. I also enjoy watching anime fights and i am a fan of anime fights. Attack on titan has some amazing and memorable fights. 

Overall- 10 
JUST WATCH IT!!! If u miss out on this master piece and watch anime , u are missing out one of the best anime in existence.",2021-01-23T21:56:00+00:00,10
"Disclaimer:1. at the time writing this, i've read all the chapter of AOT Manga (some of spin off) and watch All Season, including the newest one (eps 6 right now).2. No Spoiler intended in this review, so i'm sorry if that happen. read at your own risk.i'm not gonna debate about cinematography, Plot, story telling or anything, because it's basically the same of the Manga (seriously, you can check it page by page, the camera angle is almost identical IMHO).in General, i'd like to explain my experience in watching this season finale:""It's like watching Season Finale of GOT, or berserk animation series, or playing Cyberpunk2077 on PS4 standard edition""


as both of manga reader &amp; anime viewer of AOT, i really expect the art style &amp; music composition of this Season Finale equal with its predecessor (S1 - S3). i understand that in this Finale, they change like A LOT of the production aspect, from the Animation Studio to music composer. But i still hope that it has its AOT vibe, if you know what i mean: God like drawing action animation, Full Hype Orchestrated BGM, an intimidating atmosphere in almost every episode, this anime is not for fun. In Short, it looks like a very high budget Anime Season. although up until now i have no valid info about the budget though, but still, it looks like my opinion is valid for S1-S3 and my standard for AOT anime is justified. It's a WONDERFUL experience, it may be one of the best anime adaptation ever for me.

With that hype and hope in mind, i watched the season Finale, and boy oh boy that i was shocked. For what's good or not-good, here's what i have experienced so far:
1. The Opening animation &amp; OST is so deific, i like it.

2. The art style is completely different, there's no bold line on character face etc. in short, it's pretty much like a colored manga. which is still fine by me. i guess they want to be as precise as possible with this finale adaptation.

3. The BGMs were not HYPE at all, and also seems out of place for me. for instance, they should put a full hype blowing BGM at the end of Declaration of the War. Seriously, think about it, fell it. when i read the manga, i imagined the BGM is like YOUSEEBIGGIRL type, you know what i mean right? e.g this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXVE1Rr8XtE&amp;list=LL&amp;index=7 (spoiler alert)
the point is, it should be a very major HYPE scene and they make it like ""mmmmm ok?"" . i prefer the composition by Hiroyuki Sawano TBH.

when you read the manga, it's very confusing at first to get into Eren's head, you can't predict what Eren will say or do in that situation, what's his motive etc and suddenly BAM!!! Dear God it should be really HYPE. I'm still pissed by it.

4. 3D rendered action scene? seriously MAPPA? :( ..... This is Berserk all over again... if you watched the fight between Levi and Beast Titan and then compare it to the fight sequence in finale, you'll understand my disappointment. My opinion about budget cut is based on this actually. This is my biggest disappointment so far. it's like an off switch for me. if it's not AOT, maybe i could just get along with it, but this is AOT we're talking about. The Only 3D rendered action character that i can accept was Colossal Titan in previous season, that's all.

when i combined all of those 4 aspect, up until now, i still don't get the Grand Theme of this season, is it despair? is it the redemption? is it madness?

Overall, it's an OK series if you haven't watch the previous season or have no HYPE meter like me. BUT if you're just like me, please don't expect much.

It's still on 6th Episode, so i hope somehow they can change my mind in the future.",2021-01-21T01:48:00+00:00,6
"Attack on Titan has come a very long way from its origins as a seemingly basic Shounen story. Attack on Titan constantly twists and surprises you with new expansions to the amazing world-building, extensive lore, and interesting characters. This show takes tropes and flips them on its head to create something entirely unique and fantastic. The music is great, the art style is great, the characters are great, and just about everything else within AOT is absolutely fantastic. If I had one criticism, it would be that the CGI can be a bit jarring at times, however, the CGI is also extremely well done attimes with dynamic camera movements, smooth blending, and some other good CGI techniques. I can only hope that the rest of the anime lives up to the hype and follows in the manga's footsteps to create one of the best anime of all time. Also, it's better than FMAB so time to dethrone it.",2021-01-19T21:11:00+00:00,10
"SPOILERS for Attack on Titan seasons 1-3 (and Claymore, for comparison's sake)!I can see that many of the negative reviews for AOT season 4 are awfully nitpicky. I'm not gonna engage in nitpicking and I am not going to latch on to the show's plot holes either. I feel like there are broader and more important elements for me to critique than the minute details. If stuff like the physics of the 3D Maneuver Gear bother you, I don't know how you made it this far with the show.What happened to Attack on Titan reminds me a lot of what happened to Claymore (manga) manyyears ago. The entire setting you knew, the one you thought you should care about, turns out to be just a small island in a larger world. A fly in an evil empire's militaristic soup. The monsters that you remember once sending shivers down your spine are revealed to be just weapons of war - things that can be created and even controlled. The lens, through which you observe the story, is now zoomed so far out, that all the struggles, drama and horror you went through with the show's characters before, now seems terribly small and insignificant.

But. Claymore at least had the decency to brush aside it's awful attempt at a shocking plot twist after it didn't really land for anybody. It wrapped up the story in the confines of the setting it had already established. The damage had been done and the twist had made everything worse, but at least it remained a concise story. Attack on Titan on the other hand doubles down on it's twist hard. While I kinda want to commend it for sticking to it's guns, the fact is that this is not even the same story anymore. This is an entirely new setting with new stakes and rules. Even new cast, really. There are enough new characters that get introduced during season 4 to fill up the entire character roster of an average anime series. I got nothing against expanding the scope of a series. It can keep things fresh and interesting. But this isn't expanding. There is a difference between expanding and just throwing the original premise in the trash.

Ever since season 1 ended, almost every new detail we have learned about the world has made the once cool and compelling setting less and less interesting. Was the Colossal Titan something that caught your attention back in the day? Thought it was menacing? In the endless cycle of the series trying to one-up itself, not only have we already seen bigger titans, but now we hear that there are literal millions of Colossal Titans. Millions. Did you happen to enjoy the main characters' struggle in the cool walled-off world of fascism, cruelty and cover-ups? Too bad. You were just watching bunch of recluses on an island - a society, held together by memory altering magic powers. Thought the silent terror of the unintelligent, man-eating titans was really horrific? Did you get invested in the fight against them? They are just killed off-screen. All of them. The great threat to mankind done and dusted, without so much as a montage sequence to commemorate the oocasion. We still get the transforming super titans... But those turn out to be nothing more than glorified mecha suits by the end. In a way, it's actually worse than just having mecha suits, because at least a vehicle could be lost or irreparably broken, so there might be some tension related to losing one. But with the titans, you can just keep conjuring them up as long as the ""pilot"" stays alive. Here, there are no lasting physical consequences to either the pilot or the vehicle outside of death.

Let's talk about the utilization of Eren in this. I don't know if it was the call of the writer(s), the director or the voice actor, but being ""jaded"" is translated to being ""boring and monotone"". No matter what you thought about Eren as a character in the previous seasons, it was actually kinda fun seeing him get agitated - spitting out (often hollow) threats and making bold claims. Screaming in rage or in terror. Crying his eyes out. Whether you thought he was oblivious, stupid or annoying, the character had some energy to him. Almost every single line of Eren, as delivered during season 4, sounds like he is one second away from falling asleep. You might call it character development - I call it yet another thing ruined. Not all development is good development and a stagnant character is better than a boring, passionless edgelord. I think I can just barely swallow the shift in Eren's morality, but not in his behavior. As a direction to take Eren towards, this could have worked, but it's pushed way too far.

The most frustrating thing about Season 4 is that, in a vacuum, there are still some neat things going on. The presentation is still more than fine and some of the dramatic peaks were undeniably effective and decently set up. There are even some deeper themes being explored than what we are used to in the show's previous seasons. As a detached, individual anime story, this could have been all right. But because this exists in the Attack on Titan ""universe"", it is hard for me to pay attention to anything that is going on beyond a once-so-awesome series that has systematically driven itself into the ground.",2021-10-22T07:14:00+00:00,4
"Maybe Minor Spoilers:AOT was a show I watched very late too the hype, I started when season 3 part 2 was out and had been for a while, and when I started watching I couldn't stop, staying up late too watching more and more and when I finished season 3 part 2 in my eyes I viewed the show as a modern day masterpiece, everything I wanted it to be it was, and as soon as I finished S3 P2, season 4 was announced and I was so hyped to continue of this amazing adventure, and after waiting and waiting, it came out, but Ididn't watch until all 16 episodes were out.

In my eyes season 4 was a failure in a couple of ways, the main problem I think of when watching this was, all the way at season 1 we were introduced to this trio of Eren, Armin and Mikasa and I really enjoy how they all bonded, every season getting to see how each of them would grow and develop, they to me were like a perfect trio, I saw no flaws with them, all the character development they went through was just thrown out of the window after the time skip, Mikasa and Armin do fuck all, Eren is a fucking dickhead now, for what? to ruin everything you spent fucking years building up? I'm honestly confused about this whole god damn season.  It felt like I was reading a fucking essay with all of this dialogue, and yes I hear all these people praising the ""Masterpiece writing"" of season 4, and I completely disagree, I feel like that writing just flew over my head, which it might not have for you but to me it was the same thing ""oh yes the rumbling"", ""yes do the rumbling"", ""oh no the rumbling"" episode after episode, every episode that when past it was all boring, repetitive talking, everything that was happening made 0 sense. It feels like I would understand more reading a book backwards than this season. 

The next criticism I have is about character again, but mainly Eren. Season 1 Eren was a young full of life boy, excited to join the scouts and achieve his goal, Season 2 Eren was a up and coming scout making massive moves in the kingdom, Season 3 and Part 2 Eren fighting some serious battle against some of the strongest titans, and facing some harsh hard ships on the way to the end. In every one of these seasons Eren is making his way up to his goals with his titan powers, he's well liked, his closest friends have the tightest of bonds, everything about Eren from Season 1 to Season 3 part 2 was what I wanted from him, him making steps to achieving his over arching goal, the nice, happy, full of like boy was fucking gone in Season 4, every single thing they had done was gone, he became the biggest dickhead I had ever seen, all of these friends he made on the way and even his closest 2 friends Armin and Mikasa he treated like literal shit, what for? I was legit felt like I was watching a new show, or a butchered version of this masterpiece, but no they just decided to do nothing and make Eren a dick, thats all Season 4 is.

Then the next problem I would say is nothing fucking happens, there was 1 thing in 16 episode that wasn't talking, and it was like 2 episodes, like really, all you did was repeat the same thing for 16 episodes and call it a done season, like please actually stop saying the same fucking thing and so something, ""yeah lets do the rumbling"", and ""rumbling is the only way"" and ""the rumbling"" and ""the rumbling is the best way"", ok then stop sitting down for 9 episodes and do something towards that goal, yes they cant do the rumbling straight away but they could be doing anything else that isn't talk about it, plan out what to do after, what going to happen, what are the downfalls, up sides, what could go wrong, and if something goes wrong we should prepare before hand, but they think drinking tea and looking out of a window while saying RUMBLING is gonna do anything.

I'm honestly really mad about this show and knowing what happens at the end of the manga doesn't feel like a justified ending, this shows gave me many good emotions, this was one of the actual goats of the new anime era, but they made a whole new show after the time skip, they gave every character different traits than the seasons before, like really just stop, I wish I never watched S4 so I could go on remembering this show as a masterpiece but I cant anymore, and I understand that the main ideal of S4 was the writing but when that doesn't matter to you all that's left is boing, useless dialogue, characters you used to love now being the complete opposite they were the season before.

Overall enjoyment of this season I would give it a - 3
But the way it ruined the whole series for me makes me want to give it a - 1
Im gonna end of saying this, fuck season 4 of AOT",2021-06-25T17:41:00+00:00,1
"I'm Rating it as an anime adaptation and it is quite possibly the most ""over-praised"" I've seen. The animation is abysmal and the staff also knows it I'm not  judging based on sympathy we're rating a finished product or in this case unfinished.I mean who would expect a masterpiece of a quality of a rushed production?In any case there were barely any animation most of the animation the whole 16 episodes was in episode 2 ,7 and 8 outside of those episodes most of the linework is bad most didn't even look corrected by the ADs the choreography is bad even in important keyepisodes. especially the later episodes like episode 12 onwards.

(not all are bad there were good later episodes for production quality and good storyboard like only episode 15) as for early episodes episode 3 is just shit production then the horrendous episode 6 aside from few good cuts (mikasa vs warhammer) the rest of the episode was just poorly done and quite frankly show the production hell. especially the part where Eren just transformed off-screen that was disgusting to look at as an animation fan the cut corner for an important ep like it
and what more it passed with the storyboard it was intentional and it sucks that they didn't really prepare for the episode at all making the whole ep feel like it's made just to adapt you can't see any signs of love for adapting AoT Season 4



and they didn't even used CG to their best ( before you go off at """"you just hate CG"" ""MAPPA CG g0oD"") It's not good you are just used to shit CG. Good CG anime however like Gembutt Anime and Beastars those are the good ones but not to the point its Great so what is AoT s4 then?

then with Music, I don't usually care about music but there's a big lack in music with this they had to repeat so much of Ashes Fire every episode outside episode 7 most of the OST were just ashes fire replays.

Overall a rushed production that shouldn't had been. Animation is bad and I don't care which studio that makes it I'm solely judging it as a product with no regard of circumstances as all should be when rating something",2021-06-07T02:08:00+00:00,4
"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSThis season is highly overrated. I'm not comparing it to other anime but I'm comparing it to s1, s2, s3, s3p2. I'm confused why this season's rating is higher than s1 when it should have been lower. 1. CGIs. Don't get me even started with ""The cgi was good"" or ""2D titans is bad"" or ""Reiner titan needs to be detailed so choosing cgi is wise"". CGIs ruined my watching experiences for AoT. Watching CGIs in anime is like watching a toy with anime background. Yes, the actual anime is the background. The color and dimension just does not fit with anime.Even the frame is lagging for CGI. (Waiting for Beast to grab cannons took me forever)

2. Consistency. In eps 3 we get Reiner flashback and we got Armored from s1 (yayy). But then when Reiner was charging, it changed to CGI?? Really??

3. The timeline adaptation. In eps 2 we got Reiner with his family, and then the scene changed to something until end of eps. Next episode we got Reiner in bed to proceed with flashback. THE TIMELINE IS NOT THE SAME WITH MANGA. Idc about how hard it is to adapt chapter to eps because it made me confused.

4. Pieck's crawling scene. Again, with the timeline adaptation. The scene where we should have gotten pieck's crawling, we didn't. And next eps we got the scene. What?? I would rather not watch the crawling instead watch it in different scene with no connection of the scene and the next scenes.

5. The adaptation. So many scene removed from the actual manga like Reiner (flashback) wrote a lot of loyalty to marley, Annie running from titans, and Eren escaped from prison with warhammer power

6. I don't know if this cgi too or not. But the paradis's force is lagging when they were in marley's rooftop. It looks like a toy to me.

7. The timeline. This is actually a problem from the manga too but the anime should make this better. So we got a scene where zeke stayed in Giant Forest hotel, and a couple scenes after that. But then suddenly a whole month passed?? How tf a month passed just like that with just scene of Darius's death, Gabi's run away, and restaurant scene? (and some scenes I totally forgot but idc). I remembered from s1 we got couple of episode just for the survey corps went to Giant Forest from dawn till dusk.

8. This is actually my personal opinion. But the same opening and ending for 16 episodes make it dull. Yeah there is anime out there who got same op and ed for 50+ eps, but the ratio of episode to song is much higher than this season (which is 1:1)

===============================
CONTAIN MANGA SPOILERS BELOW
===============================

9. In episode 16 we get Zeke in titan's stomach or so. And the scene proceed with the war begun. This is a problem for the timeline when The war should have been begun after Zeke meet Floch in the manga. This make it weird because Zeke's arrival would be delayed and eren would be dead. Although they (the studio) wouldn't care much about this, but this detail is what make Aot great.

===============================




In conclusion: I think the studio can make this season much better than it was. Regardless for the CGIs (coz a lot of aot fans are defending it), there are still many problems with this season. I was astonished with season 1 because it make a new creation of fiction for me. But this has ruined it. I suggest for you to just read the manga from the start because I don't know how they will proceed with s4p2. The manga is better than this adaptation.",2021-05-19T01:19:00+00:00,3
"From the out-of-this world animation that we've got for all of the past three series, to full CG fights between both titans and humans. All titans are 100% CGI and yes, you can tell. You can tell perfectly at every single moment. Whether it's an all-out battle moment or just Eren in titan form moving his head, it's all done in janky CG.It feels like I'm watching an Attack on Titan themed cutscene from the Simpsons game on the Wii. A complete insult to all the great work of WIT studio who used CG very efficiently and non-intrusively.The animators not being at fault for havinghorrendous production schedules doesn't make this suddenly good.",2021-05-01T16:07:00+00:00,1
"Anything that ends with a pro-fash message gets a zero. Despicable, and it makes me even sadder to see so many people praising it.This series has been on the receiving end of ""is it fascist"" controversy since the beginning, which from the start I didn't buy, since it seemed to be a series about the ills of nationalism. Oh was I ever wrong. This ended in the worst way it could have and it sickens me to my stomach to see people defending a piece of media so unapologetically sympathetic toward fascism and ethnic cleansing. Though, I guess I shouldn't expect much better from suchprolific anime fans. I guess I had hoped to see better on here.

In the future, try to be a bit more critical of the media you consume outside of ""story good/story bad."" You may find yourself accidentally supporting media that endorses some truly despicable ideas.",2021-04-20T21:30:00+00:00,1
"This is a review on the whole story, not just this portion of it.Shingeki no Kyojin, when it began, presented a very enthralling mystery. People living locked inside cities with very tall and thick walls to protect them from the roaming titans outside the walls trying to eat them alive. Nobody knew why things came to be this way, nobody knew about the world outside the walls. The mystery just kept getting thicker and thicker and it seemed like unravelling it will take a long time and it will be really interesting.Which was only an illusion, things did not get better with the story, theygot worse instead. Some people rate the anime as bad, some rate the art as bad, some rate the manga as bad. I rate all of it, altogether as bad - the story itself and what the author envisioned fell flat on its ass as it went on. In a way it would have been better if the story ended prematurely, unfinished, because as it evolved and came to a conclusion is just disappointing and annoying.

For me the art, music and everything is OK, it looks well enough to see stuff and hear stuff, complaining about things look is outright pretentious, ridiculous and should not be taken seriously by anyone possessing at lest to barely functioning brain cells. 

The problem is the story and I will briefly explain why it is disappointing without spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen the whole story. The problem is as the mystery began unravelling, it devolved, it was not epic, it was not shocking, it became stupid. Characters started switching alignments (or were depicted as such) - characters the audience thought as good became bad, bad ones became good and so on and so on. These tropes are what has been happening in Latin American telenovelas (soap operas) for the past 30 years - dumb plot, characters changing sides, needless drama, lots of useless talking and declaring intentions, people going on verbal essays on who they like or hate, who they agree or disagree with. It's just very simplistic drama, procured by a severe lack of imagination, aimed at a simpleton audience who will gasp at every moment and observe the story with eyes and mouth wide open the entire time.

It just doesn't work anymore when you've been there dozens of times before, it's just the same old, same old, disappointing, annoying... in other words ""How to kill your story 101"".

Whoever enjoyed the story of Shingeki no Kyojin, good for you, but this is not the first time for me when an anime/manga/story has gone for far too long for its own good and has devolved into a senseless drivel. Seen it happen with Hunter X Hunter, Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Boku no Hero Academia, One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100, Shaman King, Yu Gi Oh! and a few more. Sometimes stories just have to be  concise and just end when they have to rather than go on for long enough so that their authors have a chance to ruin them just so they can artificially prolong them and make more money out of them.

TL;DR - Started out amazing, ended up into a huge disappointment and a steaming pile of trash.",2021-04-16T03:27:00+00:00,5
"Attack on Titan: The Final Season is at best a step down for the series, and is at worst an insult to the first 3 seasons and all the care that was taken to realize this story's potential.  Little bit of backstory here. When I decided to rewatch the series during this summer I had expected to not be impressed and simply feel completely vindicated in my sleeping on this huge titan of a show. I ended up watching all of it in one day, and even a hateful spiteful bastard such as myself who will let his intitial preconceptions taint my view ofanything had to swallow my pride and admit that seasons 1 - 3 of Attack on Titan, while certainly having its downsides, is a beautiful piece of work with ample amounts of directorial flair, gorgeous visuals, engaging characters, and a plot that kept my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end.

Attack on Titan: The Final Season is not what I wanted, and I have a hard time believing that this is what anyone wanted.  

Make no mistake- this is not just a visual downgrade from WIT Studio, this is an ugly, ugly show taken on its own merits disregarding the seasons that came before it. It honestly has taken me for a loop the fact that more people aren't seething that this is what Attack on Titan has come to. 

The character artwork is static and completely devoid of any kind of intensity of emotion. In an attempt to make the show more manga-accurate, we now have scenes of intense drama where it is difficult to ascertain the feelings of the characters and just how the events are affecting them on an emotional level. Their eyebrows move very little, their eyes appear glazed over, and the heavy shadows over their facial features, something that should be reserved for an intense emotion, are just there all the time and make every character look completely stone-faced and bored. Character designs are homogenized, with little in the way of proportions or features that could inform us about their character, and the way they move is stiff and lifeless. 

The animation itself is where a lot of the bigger issues come to rise. People who tolerate the CGI in this season seem to misunderstand where it is the issues lie when it comes to this stuff. The CGI looks bad because there is a heavy visual disconnect between the humans and surroundings and the CGI of the titans. The momentum of the fight scenes is floaty, the textures are abnormally smooth and don't retain the same shading that the rest of the show does, and they move so quickly and appear so weightless that you'd be forgiven for forgetting that they're supposed to be giant huge monsters. When it's used on human characters, for sequences like the 3D Maneuver Gear scenes, it looks even worse. All of the intensity of motion and exhilarating action from the previous seasons has been reduced to someone clicking on a stiff 3D model of a character and swinging it around with reckless abandon. Episode 5 or 6, where it's the huge fight and Eren finally gets ready to fuck shit up, is the absolute worst offender of everything I've just said. A mockery of a fight scene that is so incomprehensible and poorly staged that I almost dropped the show right then and there.  

As a result of the poor visual presentation of the show, the story suffers as well. The boring direction and shot flow only serves to amplify the series' needless complexity, with all this founding titan and curse of Ymir and Marley and all this other shit that amounts to nothing. Nothing about all these different titan powers serves to heighten the emotion of the story, nothing about the Ackermans being this special race serves any purpose to add something truly substantive to the story, and so on. The story fails to land due to poor handling and long, essay-like episode scripts that only bore the viewer with an endless onslaught of information that goes nowhere in the end. Attack on Titan's visual direction was the hook that got people invested in the story, and now that there's no hook, the story falters.

Put it this way: Anime is a visual medium. The visuals of your show matter as much as your story does. You can make whatever story you want, with whatever masterful subversions and deep characters your brain can muster, but if the visual component is lackluster and fails to sell the viewer on the ideas being put forth, I would consider that a failure from a production standpoint, which is where the heart of my discontent with this season lies. 

Attack on Titan, a show that has been renowned for it's INCREDIBLE visual direction, a show that has made big emotional moments hit so much harder and leave a lasting impression on you, has been reduced to a great studio fundamentally mishandling the visual aspect of this show. I'm sure Mappa tried their hardest and did what they could given the time frame, but what we have is still what we have. this is the Attack on Titan: The Final Season that we are going to get, and there are no do-overs. This is the legacy of this show now.  

Anime, similarly to TV and film, is a medium that fuses its many different aspects together with each other to create something beautiful; a gorgeous dance between sound, visuals, and storytelling that come together to create a truly resonant piece of work. I am speaking as someone whose life has been changed by the media I've consumed, whose understanding of the world has been deepened through the great works of art that I have enjoyed. Art, in all its forms, is as necessary to the human condition as breathing. As humans we seek to be understood, to express ourselves. At a fundamental level, art is an extension of ourselves and what we feel, and is a beautiful way to funnel our creativity and emotions into something that other people can latch onto and feel the emotions of the creator through their work. 

Despite my preconceptions on the series, please know that it doesn't bring me any joy or happiness to see a truly resonant work of art be reduced to this. To have, what was most likely going to be an incredible story, given such a rushed adaptation. Perhaps if I had been more invested in the first 3 seasons I'd find something more to like about this season, but to me this show's flaws are abhorrently obvious and apparently that's a hot take of some kind. I try not to cast aspersions towards anyone's intent for liking a show, but the fact that this season, with it's flaws so brazen, has rocketed up the ranks on MAL's top 50 is a testament to the brainless, idiotic hype culture that has surrounded this show for years now. Calm and honest critiques on the show's quality are thrown to the wind in favor of vague, generalized statements on how this show is a masterpiece, and only serves to stain the legacy of this show by showing how reactionary and impulsive this community really is.  

TL;DR 
Unengaging, unimpressive, and unsatisfying. Ladies and gentlemen, Attack on Titan: the defining masterpiece of our era.",2021-04-07T10:46:00+00:00,3
"This is my first review of the year and I just wanted to say, For me the animation did go down a bit from the previous season and I understand why, but I enjoyed every episode when I started watching it until it ended and I realized that the goosebumps, excitement and curiosity when watching was the same as the previous season, Many people are disappointed but I understand they just haven't been able to move on from the past and they feel weird and shocked .btw, good job for all the people involved in making this amazing project. good luck.",2021-04-01T23:07:00+00:00,10
"Attack on Titan, it feels like everyone is pointing a gun at you the moment you decide to write a review about the show and especially now that the first half of the final season started airing. Attack on Titan has been the talk of the hour for years, but now, more than ever. So Here's one that won't offend anyone.Story (9/10):Attack on Titan might have started its fame because of the action and hype-driven battles, but that shifted bit by bit till it became the classic literal masterpiece that everyone likes to claim it to be.The final season started from the get-go on amuch darker tone than we used to, more mature and with higher stakes than ever. It's no longer a tale about the boy that wants to slaughter Titans, as every insignificant move can result in a worldwide conflict, the politics got more involved and an essential part of the story, even more so than season three, the revelations from the past season did not only impact the characters, but also the world and the passage of events.
Season by season, Attack on Titan only got more deserving of rewatches, as every season lead you to restart the series from season one episode one in fear that more things might have gone past you with little context or clue, the show has almost become a metaphor of its former self, heroes are not villains and vice versa, trust no one even the characters you empathized with for three earlier season.

Art (7/10):
This is a controversial one. It's either Mappa's efforts into utilizing CGI more were a big mess or Wit studio put the bar higher than what Mappa could deliver on. What the series was famously praised on in the earlier season was the phenomenal use of dynamic 3D  cameras and the blend of 2D and 3D animation to the point of being impossibly noticeable is all gone, all that remains are grotesque and ugly 3D models used for the environment and Titan models, calling it ugly in this circumstance doesn't necessarily mean bad, it was decent 3D animation, far from bad, however, not as good as the three earlier seasons spoiled us about. I guess no matter how big production is, a studio change leaves grave marks.
The character designs are closer to the Manga's so that's a plus for Mappa, however, Wit did a flawless job on that that the Anime became so many people's headcanon.
The animation was the weakest part of this season, but not as bad as something that would ruin the experience, this season has more focus on the plot than action so it can easily be overlooked as it did not hinder what's important. The story. 

Sound (8/10):
Another controversial aspect of the show, I don't want to call out an entire fandom, but some people are just as mad as to send death threats to the show's staff just because they did not put their favorite OST on a certain moment, guys, grow up.
The opening and ending theme songs followed the show's trend of actually keeping up the quality. The opening was something very, very different from what we're used to which I thought reflected perfectly the hellish atmosphere that engulfs this entire section of the story.

Characters (9/10):
The best thing about a time-skip season is seeing how much the characters changed, Attack on Titan hit the nail so hard on this one that the cast is practically different people with the same names.
Take these three characters as an example, Eren, Zeke, and Reiner.
Eren has definitely grown so much in the past three seasons but that did not come close to what he has become. Entire mood and charisma change, he really reflected the burden the entire island's expectations on him, he is no longer someone who wants to slaughter the Titans because of what they robbed him of, he is the key and hope of everyone that has been living on Paradise since ay one, thus making him an unstoppable force that won't fudge in front of anything and anyone who's holding him back. Taking a look at Zeke, the bastard hated the bad guy who did so much damage to the protagonists and their cause, cursed by so many fans has won back a great deal of following by showing a growth unmatched by most characters ending up as a non-shallow fellow who also has dreams and aspirations worthy of respect. The same goes for Reiner, the traitor backstabber that appears to be like the sweetest most loving big brother figure and mentor, he grew through his struggles and is still suffering from them as he shifts between both sides of living and death, he's had enough, but to what end.
And it does not stop at that three characters,s every single character introduce earlier even for a split of a second got time to shine and show how much it has progressed. Other than the familiar faces we grew to hate and love, so many new characters were introduced, and even moments after their introduction felt like fellas that we knew since day one, perhaps due to the parallel similarities in the case of Eran and Gabi for example, but that's a discussion for another day.

Enjoyment (9/10):
It's apparent, anyone watching four seasons of a show loves it enough to give it as many chances like that. Season four was a breed of its own, quite symbolic that everything changes even the story shifts as the production studio changed, signaling a metaphorical end to an era and the beginning of a new one. A round every conversation's conclusion lies a shocking revelation or a story changing confession, things changed faster than most people can keep up and it's a point of strength in Attack on Titan's case as it was made from the ground up to make more and more sense as you keep rewatching it over and over again.

Overall (8.4/10):
A good show gives, but a great show keeps on giving, Attack on Titan doesn't o that by the seasons but by the episode, no wonder it got to the place it's now. It's almost Attack on Titan IS the Anime fandom at this point, everyone is talking about it, every conversation is revolving around it, it's almost as anyone not into it is not even in the Anime fandom, to begin with. I know that's a toxic thought to share, I don't believe in it but everyone makes it out to be the absolute truth. This season is a wild card, it's either liked or loved, nothing in between, people who adore the previous season may detest it, and people who disliked all earlier seasons might fall in love with it, that's how different everything was about this season.",2021-04-01T07:04:00+00:00,8
"What an utter disappointment. Cannot believe this season is rated as highly – for me, it is inexplicably all-over the place. We skipped years of important events and developments only to meet brand new characters for the first time. There is the same build-up we have already seen with Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. The story now revolves around this new bunch of kids we suddenly are obliged to deeply care about. Suddenly, we are thrown into a flashback where we are told (yes, not shown) all the truth about the world “Across the Sea” and quickly “walked through” the events three years ago which leadto what we saw at the beginning of the season. Why choose a flashback instead of doing it the proper way and showing the actual events? 

In fact, the main story also plummets as soon as we discover the “secret” of the Titans and the motivation of the characters seems to be hanging in the air. Like a substantial part of the development was just cut off for no apparent reason leaving us with quite an unsightly piece to chew on for 16 episodes. 

Leaving all sense aside, the story itself loses pace and jumps from situation to situation without any relevance or rhythm. The anime seems to have switched from action to talk and from showing to telling which does nothing for the story. 

One of the anime’s strongest points - the fights and the incredible Survey Corps, are thrown so back into the picture that they seem completely blurred out. Every episode has at least 10 mins of sitting and talking unnecessarily without reaching anything meaningful. 

This is just bad storytelling or a really bad adaptation.

The animation itself has taken a sharp plunge downhill with everyone looking alike, so overall, we end up with odd CGI and a bunch of potato-heads sitting and talking. 

Again, I am stunned this season is the best rated yet. I would honestly rather watch paint dry…",2021-03-30T09:23:00+00:00,3
"--- The review contains spoilers---Attack on Titan is a modern classic we are experiencing firsthand. It's art being made right infront of your eyes and you just can't do anything but enjoy its beauty. It is one that brings forth unique ideas about how to create and develop characters and drives a narrative that focuses entirely on humans and their nature. Even with the change between the studios, we are still witnessing one of the anime GOATS being made and we should be glas we are here for it. If I were to choose one element that AOT excels at, it would be the dialgoue.In fact, most of my favorite moments of the show are just people taking and the ideas they bring. We all knew about anime or tv shows that have a standard set of dialgoue to go through where it is just sentences with no relation as if the words coming out are void or lackluster. Maybe that's why I loved the anime so much. The ability to make you invested like that and feeling the tension from even the shortest bit of dialgoue shows how well-written they are and what exactly made them that effective. It takes dedication to write something as good as that and it clearly shows and rewards the creator when doing so. 

The anime's focus on Psychology is great. The transformation from Eren to Chad Eren for example was great. His character felt like it evolved from a child-like mentality to something more sinster and understaning of what is happening in the world. He is no longer the naive kid seeking revenge but instead someone that is reaching for freedom and the desire to live with no regrets nor shackles. 
Levi is also another great example with him rethinking everything, the idea that maybe, just maybe, all his choices have been wrong and that he has been fighting for the wrong people with the wrong purpose. 

The anime is able to present the psychological damage and the effect of being raised in a loving family or an obsessed tho they aren't the only reason for someone's character to break or go rogue.

While I had some things I disliked about the sound directing in some bits and the lack of new OSTs, the anime itself was done almost flawlessly. I disliked the animation once during the ""Breaking the crystal"" scene. Other than that, I really loved watching it and even the CGI bits were done nicely. 


The anime's characters are pretty much the high point and the diversity of them and how they change and evolve overtime is amazing. No character feels repetitive and their goals are clear. It may seem extreme but given the circumstances, they are justified and most of the time are a result of someone missing-up while teaching them. Everything has a reason and everyone gets development which is something I loved watching. 

The voice acting being one of my favorite parts and the performances of both Yuki Kaji (Eren) and Yoshimasa Hosoya (Reiner) are ones that should be followed when it comes to voice acting.

Overall, I would give it a 10/10. A masterpiece nearing its finale. 
Would recommend the whole series.",2021-03-28T11:40:00+00:00,10
"I, honestly, have no words. Each episode leaves me awestruck. With plot twists around every corner and more depth and pain revealed with each character's backstory, Attack on Titan is truly the best show I've ever watched. I don't consider myself one to overhype things or provide too much praise with my word choice, but I can confidently boast that AOT is a masterpiece. From the beginning of episode one, with its powerful, horror-anime like exposition, to the most recent episode of the fourth and final season, this show has never left me bored or unimpressed. There's so much foreshadowing included in the early episodes,that when put together, results in scenes so impactful that cause one to step back and stare blankly at the screen. 

The story carefully unfolds from its narrow perspective of life inside the walls, to that involving cross country politics and internal wars, and following along this story has been such an eye opener. It's realistic regarding its war dynamics and how neither side is wrong. Both are fighting for what they believe in and who they love. AOT uses this sense of realism to divide the audience, never allowing us to truly hate one side and not another. AOT brings in the elements of fantasy with the creative roles of titans, the different types of titans, and the myths of their origins.

All the characters that we've been with throughout our journey have changed so much. From their distant, youthful selves, to their now complex, multi-faceted personalities. There's so much to discover and embrace with every character.

This anime also encompasses so much suffering and really brings forth these raw emotions to its audience. This is just the tip of the iceberg and I could go on and on about the plot and endlessly explore the complexity in this story that Isayama has brought to us.

Moving on, this masterful plot is appropriately complemented with music that suits the intense and remorseful scenes. With a vibrant, booming opening, a chilling, melancholy ending, and the tense instrumental, the music goes above and beyond my expectations. I'm sure a lot of work was put into composing these songs and it's evident that the work has paid off.

Regarding animation, Studio Mappa has brought to us beautifully animated panels with vibrant lighting and smooth transitions. Despite all the hate that the studio has been receiving, it surpassed my expectations and I believe that it did a wonderful job. It does the manga justice, with scenes that match up perfectly to those inked in the book, and characters that closely resemble the originals.

I enjoyed this very much. There was not a moment in which I began to lose interest. All the important elements were fantastically executed, especially that of the story and character development, and they contribute to my final score of a 10/10. 

If you haven't started AOT or haven't yet seen the final season, I urge you to begin them as soon as possible. You will not regret it.",2021-03-23T20:25:00+00:00,10
"I think one thing that stands out about Attack on Titan just by pure mention of it is how immensely popular it is. But now that we're in the final season, does it deserve all it's hype? I think Attack on Titan is a good show, but it's not as brilliant, profound, or even as perfect as people tend to praise it as. Let me break it down.Story: 9Objectively speaking, I think Attack on Titan's story and its progression is unique and unlike many anime in recent memory. It does very well in not playing to tropes that many anime are known for, and thestory always keeps you at the edge of your seat. If you're into thrilling stories, I feel like this series was made for that very purpose. This final season is where the plot moves more than it ever has in the past, so it is definitely a wild ride.

Art: 9
Attack on Titan's art is also very unique, and animation has always been a strong point for the series. As of the final season, high-octane action sequences take a blow, but it should not be enough to effect the enjoyment of people who are invested into the story and it's progression. The style of Attack on Titan fits very well with its world, and it is marvelously novel.

Sound:8
As someone who loves Hiroyuki Sawano, music doesn't fail here, but personally, it doesn't sound too different from what he usually composes. The music in Attack on Titan can be enjoyed without the context of the show. It's a good OST.

Characters: 5
As Attack on Titan strikes me as a more plot-driven show, characters take a backseat to what is happening around the world, bar a select handful that get enough development through the story that truly makes them interesting. Primarily speaking about Reiner and Eren in this season, and Historia in previous seasons. I might be too harsh here, but the reason I believe the characters are done poorly is that most of the characters aside from the handful I mentioned can be typecasted into very simple descriptions that fit a personality quirk or simple desires they embody. Aside from this, everyone in the show is fairly uniform in the fight for freedom from tyranny and terror. It's a simple, easy-to-relate idea and concept, and while for many people, it's all they need from their characters, I found it a heavily detracting factor in my enjoyment.. I'm just a sucker for more character-driven stories though, so I'll note this as a disclaimer in this section of my review.

Enjoyment: 7
Despite the praise I give to Attack on Titan's plot progression and how unique it is, it doesn't go far past that in my eyes. Themes of moral grey, fighting for freedom, and the cycle of revenge and hatred are themes that are not necessarily revolutionary in the broader scope of storytelling, and even modern media. The way the story executes its themes also plays with the audience's desire for thrill, suspense, and mystery. Speaking by my own principle then, it's hard for me judge a show as 'brilliant' by simply keeping me entertained and thrilled. It just has to do so much more and it hasn't done it for me yet. Attack on Titan is a fantastic thriller series, but I don't think it does anything revolutionary or profound in the grand scheme of its entire runtime (or at least not yet as of the time of this review). 

Overall: 7
All I can say is that Attack on Titan is just a really enjoyable thrill ride with a world and premise that is very unique to the medium. Unfortunately, that isn't enough for me to call it brilliant.",2021-02-27T00:19:00+00:00,7
"This season so far is rly enjoyable to follow but for me its not 10/10 yet , even in comparison, i think shiganshina arc was superior ,animation have some issus due to tight schedule so because of this titans 3d models are pretty iritating to watch from time to time,but mappa shines when it comes to close up hands drawn scenes, every close up shot looks godly, from 8ep what came out 5th one was only 10/10 ep in this season from my perspective, i was on edge of my sit whole episode antisipation was insane and rly well exeuted ,cant wait for war forparadise , right now its solid 8/10",2021-02-05T07:28:00+00:00,8
"Attack on Titan in my opinion is overhyped as of right now, but definitely not as bad as some people make it seem. (Spoilers ahead).Story: Seasons 1-3 pretty much revolves around Eren becoming a titan and joins the scouts to go beyond the walls and explore the unknown, but the whole plot felt out of place when it was revealed that Eren can see the memories of the past and future. As far as the manga and Season 4 goes, the whole rumbling thing just seemed weird, because essentially Eren is trying to save humanity, by killing humanity, which just didn't really appeal to me.But besides that, the story is actually still very good, and something new that we have never seen before, so I gave it a 7/10. 

Art: Wit had some of the best animations I have seen, the Levi vs Kenny fight made my jaw drop and the details in the characters' designs were amazing. But Wit's CGI was kind of off-putting, especially in the third season. In season 4, Mappa's excessive use of CGI brought the rating down for me, but I can still appreciate them trying to mimic the manga and the CGI was actually not as bad as I thought it was going to be when I first heard people talk about Mappa having too much CGI. So overall, also an 8/10

Sound: The OST for Attack on Titan is amazing, I don't think I need to explain myself here. But some of the sounds Mappa used were really off-putting, the sounds for the titan fights in Season 4 sounded cheap, and Mappa's use of music wasn't that great either. 8/10

Now onto the characters. Oh boy, I don't know where to begin, characters are constantly just killed off for whatever reason, whether it's for the plot or just for convenience. The moment you grow some attachment to a character, they die. If you are not the main character, you die, if you don't contribute to the plot, you die. I get that it is just a part of the story, but to me, that just seemed like lazy writing. Onto the characters themselves, absolutely no development what so ever, the only exception was Eren, but besides him, no other character had any sort of development. Eren, Reiner, and Zeke carried this category, they are the only ones with an interesting backstory and some depth, without them I would've rated this a solid 1 or even a 0. 4/10

Enjoyment: Now, despite some of the negative things I have said about Attack on Titan, it is still undeniable that this was a very enjoyable show to watch. The fights were short but entertaining, and like I said the story was unique and interested me enough to make me watch another episode and even read the manga. 9/10

Overall: 7-8/10",2021-02-01T22:14:00+00:00,7
"The entire AoT series is an incredibly written and produced anime, but this final season I feel does not cut it with the CGI. I read that MAPPA requested more time to perfect the anime, but the release was pushed forward my publishers. MAPPA is a good producer, but the animation quality of season 3 was perfection. If possible, the 2D animation style of WIT should have remained and been emulated. The CGI makes things look cheap and loses the dramatic effect that was implemented in previous seasons. Some combat scenes look like they had been made on blender, and while majority of the ODMgear scenes include 2D animation, the mix of 3D looks awkward and frankly ugly. If you have ever seen the animated version of Berserk, the characters move awkwardly like that. It simply does not create the same eye catching effect that 2D animation provides.

The sound quality was the only other issue I had with the show so far. There's a scene where the attack titan is punching another titan. The punch sound effect is so repetitive and unchanging, it sounds artificial. Eren snarling in titan form also sounded a bit weird as well.

I truly hope the animation quality improves because the story and characters and excellently written, but I feel like MAPPA can't keep up with the quality of Isayama's work. The CGI snuffs any building excitement that happens when an amazing scene from the manga is shown. Hopefully the frustrations of many other fans with regards to the distaste in CG will be heard, and the completion of AOT improved upon.",2021-01-21T20:37:00+00:00,8
"This review contains NO SPOILERS.This review is my overall critique and opinion of Attack on Titan as a complete series (not just this final season).The finale of this show has been a long time coming (nearly 8 years since the first season started). This show has garnered a huge fan base due to its unique premise and action heavy story, it is easy for a non-anime watcher to approach the show. I'm sure Attack on Titan was the first introduction to anime for many anime lovers today. That is to say; 'fanboy-ism' and bias is inescapable for such a large show like this. That's whyI think (as of the time of writing this) this show is currently ranked as number 2 best anime of all time (only second to FMA:B) undeservingly.

The amount of talent involved in the creation of this show is undeniable (specifically the animation quality), but visuals alone isn't enough to be ranked number 2 of all time (or even in the top 10). For me, the most important aspect of any TV show or movie is the story and characters (they go hand-in-hand) and unfortunately, despite the very interesting premise, the delivery of the story and the particular elements that are chosen to be the focus are not that interesting to me. This criticism is of no fault to the production company of this show, my criticism is directed more towards the source material (the manga). 

The story essentially focuses on a group of teens who are the victim of war involving 'titans'. Their journey begins when they decide to uncover the mysteries and secrets around these 'titans' (and how to destroy them). As they uncover more and more, they eventually realise that the secrets go far beyond just the 'titans' and more towards dirty politics.

^^ that is a fantastic premise. Unfortunately, due to the emotionally exhausting subject matter (war and politics), the characters themselves spend most of their time 'following the breadcrumbs' and as a result, they don't get much attention as individuals (see '3' below). Perhaps this is inevitable for all 'war based stories' almost like: ""The characters will have their day in the sun after the war has ended"". It makes perfect sense from a technical perspective, but it is still disappointing.

To be fair, the main characters *DO* receive a 'character arc' but it's just not *that* compelling. By the end of this series, I found myself only sticking around for a conclusion to the 'war' and for the cool action sequences, not for the characters. And in my opinion, that is a tragic outcome for such an interesting concept. Again, this criticism is more towards the source material (the manga) and not producers or animators.

Other specific criticisms of the story:
1) I see many people here praising the many 'twists' that the show has in store, but to me the feel more like 'cop outs'. The second something interesting starts to happen, the 'goal post' gets shifted to something far away (metaphor). When ever a 'twist' occurs, it feels more like I'm being cheated or teased rather than being given a satisfying epiphany. 

2) Maybe it's the time-frame in which this show has been produced (nearly 8 years) but I feel like even after all this time, I  *still* don't understand a lot of the story or certain character motivations. Perhaps there is another wonderful twist in store for me (sarcasm). But so far I would characterise this writing as 'leaving a lot to be desired'.

3) as stated earlier, I wish the characters got more focus as individuals. What I mean is this: I want to see the unique perspective that manifests in a child or teenager during such a fearful and traumatic time-period. The most inspiring people are those who see the good in the world despite being surrounded by so much negativity. I want to see (at least one of the main characters) possess a positive outlook towards the world, life, nature and society. Seeing a character fortify their mind with optimism would certainly be refreshing. Instead, we are left with characters who are typically sad, depressed, crying or hopeless. This is expected but it isn't something I enjoy watching.

Continuing on that last point...
'Avatar The Last Air-bender' is a pretty good example of the type of characters I would have liked to have seen. Maybe not as cartoon-ish and child like, but certainly as high-spirited as some of them. It would have made for more enjoyable characters.

P.S. I'm still annoyed that 'Avatar the last air-bender' is not added to MAL. **Anime is an art-style not a country of origin**. Studio Ghibli frequently outsources animation production to *south-Korea* as do many other animation studios (partake in outsourcing) therefore, they are not 'fully from japan'. If exceptions are made here (as they are) then why not make an exception for ATLA?",2021-01-19T21:37:00+00:00,7
"(no spoilers) The animation is breathtakingly flawless. The updated character designs are amazing. The new setting outside the walls is refreshing and just what the story needed.The soundtrack is equally brilliant and has an outstanding ability to immerse you in the world so lovingly crafted by the writers.It is one of the few shows where the wait was truly worth it. The only issue I have with this show is waiting for next week's episode. Every episode leaves me breathless and excited to see what is going to happen next.Trust the hype on this one. on a side note: if you have somehow never watchedthe first, second, and third seasons of this show you really should go back and watch it the world-building is amazing.",2021-01-19T04:12:00+00:00,10
"Short review just to summarize how I feel so far without any spoilers.Attack on titan somehow always manages to go a step forward with every season. And this one delivers again.The show flips everything upside down and really makes you think again about moral and story stuff that seemed obvious a season or 2 ago. The story telling and dialogue are at such a high level It's insane and because of that you really do feel like you're witnessing something special every episode.The only gripe I have with this season so far is the animation. Considering the fact that they switched studios and that thereprobably wasn't that much time to animate everything, it makes sense that it won't live to the insane animation standard the other season set. But it's still a little dissapointing seeing all these cg characters and titans when you know how great this world looks when hand drawn, not saying it's bad but it's definitely worse then other seasons. despite that, seeing as this season is so different in concept when compared to the other ones, it doesn't bother me that much so it didn't affect my rating.",2021-01-17T14:43:00+00:00,10
"Shingeki no Kyojin, one of the best anime series all time. It's finally reaching it climax. The studio changed, but i'm surprised asf. MAPPA, they did a really great job on adapting the last season, even when they have projects like JJK & Chainsaw Man.For the art, it was surprisingly good. They covered all the important information from the manga, the characters gets more detailed, the character design was really similar to the manga, and the animation was pretty good and easy to follow.Everyone's excited for the 6th episode, im sure of it! It will decide how good MAPPA adapt the aot series, and don'tlet me down because i hope it could surpass FMAB!!!",2021-01-12T20:16:00+00:00,10
"When reviewing an episode of an entire series, we don't compare it to the series' best or worst episodes. Rather, it is the episode, to what degree we enjoyed it, and how much information and secrets It revealed.Through the episode, we were able to learn more about world politics, ethnic persecution, and what the Eldians people are subjected to.The characters' dialogues are still interesting and poignant, and their philosophical dimensions are deeper than before.Children are children, and how the previous generation knows what awaits the next generation.Cynicism, fate, the wheel that will not stop until it is broken. And all the history that was writtenand will be written.
The end is a different world and a powerful move to another level completely.
The music is great with the return of that wonderful OST.",2020-12-27T23:05:00+00:00,10
"It’s incredible. The time skip and change in setting was probably the best thing they could have done because trying to follow up from Season 3 Part 2, which is my favourite arc in all of anime, by doing something similar would be very difficult.One thing season 4 does better than the rest is making the characters much more interesting and elevates Eren from just sort of being there to being a commanding and intimidating figure who we don’t know whether to root for or not. I like Gabbie and Falco as well, and how Eren and Reiner are mirrored in their personalities and actions.Showingthe other side of the war gave the series more depth than before. It’s not just good vs evil or humans vs Titans anymore. The horrors of war are shown very well.

However, while the season has some very good action, such as the Warhammer Titan fight, the action and the animation in the action is a bit of a step down from the previous seasons. This isn’t a problem with the CGI or the change in artstyle, I actually think the CGI is pretty good and the artstyle is really good, rather there was nothing in the animation that wowed me like the earlier seasons.

Overall, the season had everything Attack on Titan has had in the past and some added elements, deepening the series. However, some the action and animation wasn’t as jaw-dropping as the earlier seasons.

I would give Attack on Titan Season 4 a 9/10.",2021-06-30T13:10:00+00:00,9
"The journey of Paradis ended 3 days ago. I hardly recovered from the PKSD, Post-Kyojin stress disorder. In the world of Kyojin, shocking is powerless, astounding is timorous while grandiose is minnow-sized.Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season is a visual and aural miracle, a flawless artwork, and an unprecedented balance: screenplay, character, production design, cinematography, editing, music, directing. On the giants of shoulders, to achieve excellence in some aspects is with ease. To achieve them all is a task that hesitated Sisyphus probably. Even though here it is.The Screenplay 97/100A specific world from the outset, vividly and with efficiency. It's onboard and oriented within thebeginning. An intrinsically visual story instead of a detailed plot. Despite the fact the genius of Isayama is unbelievable, the characters are complex and believable due to the performance of CVs is textbook-level. Unlike those who set up the most imaginative rules and failed to obey, the self-consistent logic stands there, stable and calm. ""Be water, my friend."" ""We are in front of the waterfall, my God."" I can't wait to know what happened at the end of Episode 75. Ironically, those who tried to be amusing amused us while those tried to be serious amused, too. It's a serious and cold-handed story, more than just what happened.
The history, the meaning of life, the nature of humans connected and enhanced each other. What is the communitarian answer to the Eldians, slaughtered, discriminated and enslaved for the crime they didn't do?

"I'm not a ""Attack on Titan"" fan so, if you disagree with me - no problem, I know this serie could be great for most people. Let's start with fact that AOT could be much better. In my opinion theres'e too many retrospections and they start inwrong moments. Sometimes I didn't know is it retrospection or not. However there were some great retrospections I've enjoyed.Other thing is boring moments. I don't know am I only one who is bored with some parts of aot but overall it wasn't boring serie.In first 2 seasons I had problem with remember characters. It's not a disadvantage but mystupidity however that's why i didn't enjoy 2 first seasons.
But the worst was season 3. I don't understand why it was that boring for me.
About that season - in my opinion it was the best season of whole serie. There weren't many boring parts and even retrospections were interestring. And finnaly i started to understand whole serie.
I like how that season references to history events. Overall ""Attack on Titan"" wasn't bad anime but in my opinion it could be much better.",2021-04-25T12:20:00+00:00,8
"The Miserable Final, or Final of the Miserable: On Attack on Titan: The Final SeasonThe previous seasons of Attack on Titan were not just a breath of fresh air to several genres at once, including dystopia and dark fantasy, but also have universal virtues, namely, a grandiose (titanic, colossal, as it were) plot and unprecedented lore. A strange, striking story, combining both sublime humanistic pathos and horror elements, was built on a gradually unfolding, consistent exposure of a diegetic world initially presented as a post-apocalyptic world in which humanity was allegedly almost completely exterminated by giant Goyaesque creatures called Titans. The unfolding story showed thatthe world was not what it seemed, and that the mysterious events that marked the beginning of the devastating Titan invasion (the fall of Shiganshina) had a hidden logic associated with the true state of affairs. The presence of unknown forces set in motion by this logic created the impression of multidimensionality, significance, and depth of the plot. As a result of the exposure of these forces, it was revealed that the remnants of humanity behind the walls were the descendants of people capable of turning into Titans, “the subjects of Ymir” living on the Island of Paradis in complete isolation from other nations and in utter ignorance of their existence. Moreover, it turned out that the Titan invasion that led to the tragic collapse of a long-lasting illusion had been organized by the nationalist militaristic state of Marley, the opponent of the subjects of Ymir, or the Eldians. Undercover agents infiltrated protective troops of Paradis Island turned out to be Eldians who had been indoctrinated with the anti-Eldian agenda and whose task was take possession of the most fearsome weapon of Ymir’s descendants, the power of the Founding Titan. Thus, the universe of violence turned out to be generated by the opposition of political forces, or by political struggle, the main form of which in Attack on Titan is war.
Attack on Titan: The Final Season brings the story to its close and does it in an unexpected way, again changing the perception of what is happening. The denouement is revealed from the perspective of “antagonists” (Zeke, Reiner, etc.) whose motivation was still largely unknown up to the last season. The humanistic potential of such a narrative solution is obvious. Unfortunately, its implementation can be considered, in some ways, the exact opposite of the author’s intention. Instead of righteous and sympathetic goodies of the previous seasons, characters repulsive to varying degrees (with the exception of Falco) come to the fore. All of them are victims of chauvinist propaganda, including Zeke Yeager who, in addition, in his youth was influenced by the defeatist and anti-natalist Tom Xaver. Actually, the heroes of Attack on Titan: The Final Season exist in one of two modes: they either blindly act according to some preposterous and obscure ideal or do not act at all. One of the new protagonists, pigheaded and obdurate Gabi Braun, performs only one significant action, which is the murder of Sasha Blouse. Her further presence in the story is not marked by anything worthy of note.
For the time being, Attack on Titan: The Final Season is an attempt to criticize violence as a means of political transformation of the world. The problem is that alternative ways of such transformation are not specified in the series. And although the story is not over yet, it seems that H. Isayama has already played his best cards.",2021-04-11T15:25:00+00:00,6
"The first half of Season 4 is disappointing. Most of the primary complaints I have observed are related to the art and CGI. The style change took a while to digest but fine, static as it is.Season 4 is mostly disappointing to me for the same reason the manga is (as expected). The pivotal transition from story of survival to Nazi-reminiscent, politic-fueled wartime epic at the end of Season 3 is executed in an incredibly lackluster fashion.I quite like the idea of a direction which expands the story and breadth of the SNK universe; it is great to reveal the rest of the world andit generates a fruitful way to draw the series towards its' end. 

But the story that resulted is not not nearly as good as it could have been. The timeskip that takes place and subsequent drastic change of character personality, introduction of many new characters on a whim, etc, left me feeling entirely unattached. The decision to turn practically all of the characters away from the morals and values instilled through 59 previous episodes, all at once, is such a cheap cop-out. In many ways it feels like an entirely different story. By intended design or not, it's not as fun to watch.

Naturally, I found myself not caring and it ended up being difficult to get through some of the later episodes in the first half of Season 4. I will unfortunately ride it out. Feel free to disagree.",2021-04-08T21:49:00+00:00,6
"I don't want to waste too much of my time going over what several others have already laid out in abundant detail, but with the amount of praise this season of Attack on Titan season 4 has been receiving, I feel it needs to be echoed:If you take Iseyama's source material out of the equation, Attack on Titan: The Final Season is subpar at best.And it's a shame that this opinion gets touted as being ungrateful to MAPPAs staff. Let's get one thing clear. Praising MAPPA for churning this out in an absurd amount of time only reinforces this awful practice in the industry. Thebottom line animators are not dumb. They know that they were overworked, and they know the product they put out is not great. They know that better than anyone. They literally do this for a living. Nobody at MAPPA was assigned to this project out of passion. They were assigned to this because they were the only ones available, director included. How do you think they feel knowing they got the opportunity to work on the biggest anime of the last decade and it boiled down to drawing still character frames and sloppily redrawing the arms to create lazy walk cycles? Props to them for not doing worse, but its a far cry from great work.

If there is one thing I can commend this final season on--as an animated version of the manga--it's the voice acting. As always, the established cast has done a great job, and new characters seem to be well cast as well. I haven't noticed any major decline in how voice directing has been handled either. This single thread of continuity from prior seasons is nice, at least.

But everything else? Very disappointing, to put it lightly. Allow me to haphazardly spill my thoughts:

Art style change? Great in MAPPA's trailer (false advertising by the way) but gross in the final product. It has also created an alarming amount of inconsistencies in character illustrations from scene to scene due to being more detailed than before. The character illustrations are often overly round compared to the reference materials the animation team are using. Backgrounds have gone from being absolutely stellar in prior seasons to ""use stock textures wherever possible"" now. Absolutely no time was put into them because, as we all know, there was no time. 5/10

The animation?  Anything hand drawn is stiff at best. And Episode 2 is filled to the brim with vomit inducing rotoscoping. The CG Titans are weightless, as everyone and their mom have said. And despite the models actually being decent, the actual quality of shot compositing fluctuates anywhere between passable to laughably bad, making how good the models are irrelevant, since they don't ever sit properly in the frame. Usually, lazy still frames are used in anime to help make time for other, more demanding parts of the production. Unfortunately, given the production schedule for this anime, they are exclusively used for the team to play ""catch up"", meaning there is nowhere in which the mediocrity is made up for. 4/10

Effects work? Titan transformations have receiving a considerable down grade. Basically just a yellow frame with some lines thrown in. The ""glow"" effect MAPPA likes to overuse in every anime they produce reduces the fidelity of and cheapens nearly every scene its used in. WITs color grading and effects gave this series a sense of visual clarity that stood out among other other anime, making the entire series look polished. Unfortunately, MAPPA's team likes to do it the easy way and utilize a lighting effect that basically anyone can do with Adobe After Effects and 5 minutes on YouTube. 5/10

The music? Well, Sawano's score continues to be incredible. Unfortunately, a new composer has been brought in to help ""expand"" the brilliant atmosphere previously established. These new tracks do little but detract from scenes in my opinion, as they do not gel well at all with what came before. That's not to say that they are bad tracks, but they simply do not belong here. Which makes the fact that they so often feel shoehorned into every episode all the more annoying. What was once a 10/10 has dropped to a 7/10.

One thing I don't see people talk about at all is the sound design. How is it? I'm pretty sure I've heard better sample selection from the Spongebob anime. So many times this season i've heard one-shot samples just blatantly copy and pasted back to back to back. Where are the velocity layers, MAPPA? Not to mention, the impact effects during Titan fights sound like someone put their iPhone mic next to someone's foot while they step in gravel. Where is the weight? Certainly not in the CG animation. 3/10

All this to say; for only 8 months of production (if that number is true. I have yet to validate it myself), it's actually a miracle this didn't turn out worse. But keeping a ship from sinking, and building a ship that doesn't sink in the first place are two separate things. And MAPPAs team simply kept the boat afloat. It's a shame they didn't turn down the contract. At the very least, it would've forced Kodansha to redraft their contract terms, and MAPPA--if not another studio--would've at least had a chance of producing a result capable of living up to WITs adaptation. Or at least still doing justice to what is an incredible series, in a different way.

But what we got? This isn't different. It's just bad. Season 1 of Attack on Titan, to this day, is one of the most well produced anime productions of all time. Its quality still sets a high standard that few manage to meet nearly a decade later. But this final season? It already is, and will continue to age like milk. It feels wrong having such a mediocre production dethroning FMA:B. It's sad to see Studio WIT's overwhelming talent and passion overshadowed simply because MAPPA chose to sign the contract and adapt these last chapters.",2021-04-01T17:47:00+00:00,5
"MAPPA did not ruin AoT, please shut the fuck up about that. This is an actual review without mentioning 3D CGI.This is a step down for sure from previous seasons in a more subtle way. The current director tried so hard to replicate Tetsuro Araki direction style but kinda fails. But in my opinion, that doesn't reduce the overall quality of Attack on Titan itself, because what AoT needs especially in final season is not amazing action sequences and such, but just a resolution to deep, personal level conflict. Season 3 part 1 has almost no action compared to its previous seasons, but it's oneof the most engaging season. With that said, MAPPA did AoT Final season justice. 

From sound effects to voice acting, it complement each other and makes attack on titan a treat to watch. Just for a simple scene, we can actually nitpick it and find out that MAPPA paid attention to even a smallest detail. On episode 2, 21.52 minute mark, you can see Reiner seing Gabi and Falco training, as he talks to himself, “Will I have to go again? To that island..”. This scene tells us so much how Reiner feels about his own past, even though its already been told before but this scene is just a really nice detail. He looks at gabi and falco as he reminisce his training days just before he got his titan powers and went to Paradis Island. This still picture of Reiner is not just him being serious, but also it shows that reiner is traumatized by his own past. His voice doesn’t sound like he’s being serious “ah shit here we go again”, but a depressive type of “ah shit, here we go again”.

Other than what makes AoT great, that's where my main criticism lies. It's action and music.

Even i said that AoT doesn't need this kind of hype machine anymore, that doesn't mean i can't criticize their effort to make one. For some reason, The action scenes don't feel impactful. Maybe it's because of the sound effects.

On episode 6, starting from 11.24 minute mark to 11.30 there are already some issue for me. The first one is Warhammer titan’s roar. I don’t think that the delivery from the voice actress is bad, but I do think that it lacks of editing in the sound department. You see, titan is big. When a thing as big as a titan is roaring, it should not be like this, like a regular human roar. I don’t know sound terms of this, but it should sound coming from a big ass creatures. Take beast titan as an example. His titan voice feels its coming from a big creature, echoing and feels heavy. Same with female titan and eren’s titan. This voice of Warhammer titan makes it feel less scary and menacing.

Second, the sound effects in general. When Warhammer titan smashes the ground with her big ass hammer, it doesn’t sound like it. Again, it just feels like a regular sized hammer smashed the ground. This errors in sound department really ruin the experience for me.

Third, music selection. This is not restricted only to that scene I just pointed. This part applies to this whole episode, that is episode 6. The music selection feels like just a filler. In previous seasons, the animation choreography goes well with the music. It doesn’t feel the music is chosen because it fits the scene that already been made, but the animation itself is made based on the music and the music is made based on the scene. This means the previous director had a really good communication with the composer. In this season…it doesn’t feel like it.

My complaints seems a lot, but really its just a tiny portion of the season.  MAPPA did not ruin season 4. Not at all. WIT adaptation is not perfect either, but they got many things right, just like MAPPA.

I won't talk about the story. It's just pure greatness, you gotta see it for yourself.",2021-04-01T08:14:00+00:00,9
"** Spoilers alert **Story (6/10) | Story-wise, after an amazing third season, I was expecting way more. It's not bad, but it's not excellent either. The problem lies in the fact that there wasn't a smooth transition between S3P2's story and S4's story. The change was way too sudden. I'd be fine if I was given two or three episodes where I get explained what events happened that allowed the characters to have the means and capacities to attack Marley, which, just FYI, is 100 years ahead of Paradis technology-wise, has a way bigger army and many allies it can count on. For me, thisis a huge plot hole. It's not like we don't get an explanation for some action of some character that result in a minor event happening, we're talking about the events that led to the attack that started the entire plot of this season. As much as I'd like to, I can't oversee this.

Other than that, the story is a solid 6.5-7/10 throughout the entire season. I particularly appreciated how the author and the animators managed to portray important topics such as racism, classism, etc. so masterfully and in a way that feels real. Really good job on this.

Characters (5/10) | The problem with the characters is the same as the story: their personalities changed too much too fast.

The main problem here is Eren. In S3P2 he was protective towards Mikasa and his friends, he didn't want them to get hurt. In S4 we have this depressed dude that doesn't give a shit about anyone, emotionally abuses his sister and his best friend, and is ready to sacrifice them to win the war. When I was watching those parts, I couldn't believe I was watching the same character I saw in S3P2.

Then there are the new characters. During the attack on Marley, we notice that the team has expanded and more characters get introduced. I'm honestly fine with not getting backstory from most of them. It'd be a mess to do it and it's ok. What is not ok is not giving any backstory for characters like Yelena. At the end, what we know about her is that Marley took control of her origin country, that she wants revenge and that she is a genius. Period. Nothing more.

I actually liked both Falco and Gabi, their personalities definitely stand out, and the show did a really good job making us understand how they think and why they do certain things. They also got used to give us an insight about what life is in Marley, how Eldians are treated, how they live, the consideration Marleyans have for them and the abuses they receive from people. Really good characters.

Sound (8/10) | What can I say? It's Attack On Titan, it's obviously going to have great voice acting and music. The opening for this season can seem a bit weird at first, but after listening to it a few times you start to like it. Best opening in the entire franchise for me.

Art (7/10) | I'm not the kind of person that likes to compare different shows, but I think it's fair to compare a season with one of the past ones.
The art is still good, it's MAPPA after all, but nobody can deny that the show looks weird and too different from what we are used to and that this season the animation is worse compared to what Wit did in the previous ones. The only exception I can think of is Reiner, he looks badass.

Enjoyment (7/10) | Overall, I enjoyed watching this. I think it's a worthwhile show if you want to watch something fun and action packed. It's like a drug, there's no ""one more episode and I'll stop"", you'll binge the entire season in a single sitting like I did, there's no way around, but I have to say that it left a bitter taste, and I sincerely hope that next season will be better.

"I have never understood the hype around this show, and trust me I've given it many chances, even reading till 103 chapters of its dog shit art trying to gleam any value from it. So let us start with this review. Take this review as a summary of all seasons because I will be talking about all of them in this review. This is my first review but I'll prolly write some more in coming days. Story, Messaging, Tones: 2/10: Nothing about this series is standout in terms of what messages it tries to show you. You can honestly learn more meaningful shit from a7th grade history class. Its actual structure has no impact on the reader, and gives me no actual reason to care for anything that is happening. Ever ""dark"" moment had me sitting there still not giving a shit. Oh those guys are titans, wow. Oh his mom got eaten and coincidentally by an important titan, shiver me timbers. Maybe those are super important moments to others but for me they fell flat. Mostly because the characters involved may as well been side characters and sometimes they were. Tons of no names or poorly developed slugs to be killed off for sad and pathetic shock value. The actual idealogical tones behind this series is also piss poor, mostly because one side is literally just a child raging out. Some game of thrones level decision making on who to kill as well, its literally him spinning a wheel.

Art:2/10
Worst new gen art I've ever seen. I know it's subjective, but when I can't tell characters apart and CGI looks like a fucking upgrade compared to the source material I have no idea how its appealing. Characters switch facial proportions and half of characters look the exact same to the point where I get confused on who actually died. The titans are the only well done thing in terms of design, since they are recognizable and vey visually appealing. The scenes they are in and how they are presented could use a ton of work though. Season 1/2 are an upgrade to the original source materials art, the final season still is an upgrade but such a small one It's sad. 

Sound: 3/10
Original openings were at least catchy but not really a bop that I could groove with. This most recent intro has terrible visuals and the singer is kinda trash but at least it has a decent tune to it. The osts are mostly misses with a few hits. Then we got that stupid Levi one, wtf was that. Made my ears and eyes bleed. Nothing standout on sound and below average if I was being honest. 

Character: 1/10
I hate every single character in the show. Zeke is the one character that is somewhat tolerable but even he is not well developed in the least, he seems like a Bondrewd who stopped developing at age 3. Eren has always been a piece of shit. Starting off as a crybaby, into a plot armored dumb ass, and now a literal child hitler. His motivations are garbage, his development is nonexistent, and he annoys me with his presence on screen. Even if they were trying to make him a villain he has to be the worst villain in all I've watched. Mikasa and Levi were interesting originally cus they were just cool, and then they got no character development from then on. Levi had three personality traits clean, short, and gets mad. Mikasa had one personality trait Simp. Mikasa and Levi were also completely ruined by the reveal that both of them got all their powers from being born that way as super humans and not having any actual skill or training required to get them that far. I guess thats how you justify your characters power when your power-scaling is literally just Eren ass pulls to win every fight or is just god and better than everyone and everything. Every other character is unremarkable, especially Reiner who is just an idiot whose circumstances are his own damn fault.

Enjoyment: 2/10
This could be used as a form of chinese torture. It was agony watching these seasons, and I only did so because a bunch of dumbass people who think they can recommend shit would not shut up about the only anime they have ever watched. I gave this shit like 5 chances. Well above my usual 1 to 2 at most. 

Overall: 2/10 
Its the average of the other areas, that simple. I've seen worse but thats not a high bar to cross so honestly kill me. Never recommend me this type of garbage every again.",2021-03-31T00:13:00+00:00,2
"Man, I'm so glad to have seen this anime while it was eren'! You could say Attack on Titan is really at its pieck!! Better stop armin' yourself, for there is no more need to stay arlert, AOT is back!!!  At long last, after months of warfare between fans of Fullmetal Alchemist and Attack on Titan fans, after months of debates over whether or not to fappa to mappa or to crappa on mappa, and after months of trying to decide who in the hell is in the right versus the wrong here, Attack on Titan has wrapped up the first part of itsfinal season. 
The beast shall be back for more, but man, what an experience it was. Never has Attack on Titan, a show that started off as giant naked men eating little people, been so intense, both within the realms of the show itself and in real life surrounding it. 
If you have seen previous seasons, you would know that Attack on Titan has started off as a very simplistic anime, but has slowly become more and more complex with each season. Season 1 began with giant naked men eating people, before throwing in the twist that people can become giant naked men. Then, season 2 throws in the wrench that there are people who can become giant naked men within the military fighting against them. Season 3 comes in with the revelations as to where giant naked men come from, and provides a narrative on war and idealism. Finally, this season turns everything around, making it practically impossible to decide what is truly morally correct in Attack on Titan. 
That being said, the story here is rich as hell. If you aren't absolutely absorbed into it to some extent, then you're clearly just watching for action. That being said, there is almost no action this season, with action only taking place in four episodes. Instead, we are presented with a beautiful, engaging story that simply cannot be put down.
The characters, holy shit. Your favorite character may now become one you despise, with vice versa being just as likely. The first half of this season focuses on Marley, and focuses primarily on Reiner. If you hated Reiner before this season, that is sure to change. The rest of the Marleyan warriors are all excellent additions to the cast, and ones who are quite likeable. 
The second half of this season shifts back to the dev- wait, devils?! Yes, my friends, it turns out the main characters we've spent three seasons with may not be saints after all. But my god, have some of these characters changed. Eren Yeager, the whiny little brat who slowly became more mature from his experiences, has become, well for one an absolute chad, and two, an extremely interesting character. I shall keep this as spoiler-free as I can, but I will simply say that Eren is quite, erm, interesting. I also most note how badass Zeke is, and how interesting he is as well. 
Now to address an elephant in the room. Yes. Wit took a shit, and sadly enough, Attack on Titan fell out of their ass. But that's okay, because the crappa went on to Mappa! While the art/animation is nowhere near the caliber of previous seasons, I'd still say it looks pretty solid, albeit with some questionable cgi and inconsistent character models. It doesn't detract from the experience too badly, but I definitely had a much better reaction to certain scenes that were extremely well animated, such as the finale of episode 16, compared to the cgi episodes we saw in episodes 6 and 7. You could blame Kodansha and Mappa's administration for the horrible conditions and rushed schedule, but nonetheless, it could've looked better. Could've looked far worse however, and for what it's worth, it looks good enough. 
The voice actors absolutely nailed it this season, with Yuki Kaiji and Ayane Sakura standing out to me in particular for their performances as Eren and Gabi. However the rest of the cast did absolutely amazing. Not a single scene felt lacking at all in the voice acting department. This season's soundtrack was fantastic, with the re-use of old Sawano classics as well as new tracks that absolutely slap from Kohta Yamamoto. The opening, Boku no Sensou, is so damn catchy, arguably the best AOT opening among them all. The ending theme, Shougeki, is pretty good, very pretty and also a bop. I will say, the OST used during the declaration of war scene was severely underwhelming, but not worthy of threats against Mappa either. Overall excellent sound per usual. 
I wouldn't say this is Attack on Titan's best season. Season 3 Part 2 was phenomenal and remains the best piece of fiction I've ever seen. However, this season did come pretty damn close. Despite being in the hands of an entirely new studio, with entirely new animators, directors, and other workers, as well as an extremely unreasonable 8 month production schedule, this season turned out to be quite fantastic. I cannot give it a full 10, because there were some complaints worthy of mention. The direction, while still pretty good, hasn't always delivered, which has left some scenes feeling rather dull or empty rather than absolutely slamming like they could have. The CGI, I will admit, I'm not hating on Mappa nor eating Wit's shit, but the cgi didn't look that good in my opinion. Some scenes were excellent. Episode 1's cgi was superb, and some fight scenes looked great. But in other scenes, the cgi just doesn't look that good, kinda ugly if anything. In addition, the character models here were inconsistent to a noticeable degree, and towards the end of the season, it did often feel like watching a powerpoint presentation with an audio track. However, despite these complaints, I still had a lot of fun watching Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 1, and am very excited for Part 2 when it launches next winter! Attack on Titan was absolutely on fire this season, and this is all setup for fantastic things to come. With more time given to work on part 2, and with how damn good that finale was, I have no doubt that The Final Season Part 2 will truly be something absolutely special. Go watch this season of Attack on Titan, and enjoy it. You may miss the insane action of previous seasons, but if you love the story and lore/dialogue then you are in for a real treat.

"By far the best story ever written. Attack on Titan has cemented itself as a modern masterpiece.The Final Season delivered in every aspect. The dialogue was incredible, the action scenes were breathtaking and not to mention ""Declaration of War"" had me struggling to breathe for the last 3 minutes of the episode because of how intense it was. No other show has made me sit at the edge of my seat in a scene where two people are just talking.""The Warhammer Titan"" and ""Assault"" are masterpieces in their own right and ""Children of the Forest"" managed to climb up to be my favorite AOT dialogueepisode of all time.

I am excited to see what part 2 has in store for us!",2021-03-28T12:15:00+00:00,10
"Ahh the final season for AOT. The first anime I ever watched and now I can finally rest knowing it is pretty much finished. Season 4 has reached the climax and buildup that we all have been waiting for. We know all the answers to the questions that we have been asking since season 1 began. ""Where do titans come from?"" ""Where do the titan-shifters come from"" ""Whats in the basement?!"". But even with all our interest piqued since season 3 part 2, Season 4 does a brilliant job keeping us interested in the grand finale! The story is the biggest premise in any anime/show/movies,no excuses, without a good story everything else falls apart and well to say the least they did an amazing job on this aspect. The pacing was great filled with action scenes which had so much twists and surprises and they knew the proper time to take a break and slow things down a bit. The flashbacks were absolute perfection with alot of character details to them. The setting takes in place in a complete different background then we are used too and was quiet a surprise for me. The atmosphere/tone is quiet different from the last couple of seasons it is quiet similiar to season 1. A little more light hearted but still has that level of gruesomeness and intensity. And with beautiful writing and superb directing. 

The characters were well written. This time we are in the seats of a couple of new charcters that we are introduced too mainly Gabi and Falco. Gabi, a another version of Eren but is a girl and is brainwashed by the Marleyans to think Paradis Island is filled with ""demons"", I genuinely liked her in the beginning but she did some things that really pissed me off. Falco, he seems to have more sense than Gabi and actually thinks through things before doing something irrational and has a strong dynamic with Reiner. Now for the most worthy mentions in the characters section include Eren, Zeke, and Reiner. Reiner seems to have PTSD for the things he has done and is now regretful and is filled with sorrow, we also learn more about his past and the truth for him making it to the warrior program. Eren who' s a completely changed character and Zeke haunted by his father's choices and decisions have joined together for a cause greater than themselves. And for the supporting characters such as Armin they seem to have developed over the course of 4 years from season 3 part 2 and season 4. 

Mappa did a pretty excellent job of living up to expectations. Even though the characters are quiet different from the past seasons it makes sense since it's been 4 years since season 3 part 2. The warhammar titan looked great and the town of  Liberio seemed detailed and well designed. The only problem I had was with the excessive use of CGI on the 9 titans, it really looked out of place and kinda bad to look at honestly and the empty streets of certain towns. The intro and outro music was really good but I wished they could bring back the choir and vocals for AOT music I really miss it but otherwise the sound was great!

Overall a very enjoyable anime. Even with all the obstacles, budget, and limited time they had they managed to pull through and surprise us! AOT might be one of the greatest animes of the 2010s if not the greatest!",2021-03-27T11:58:00+00:00,10
"Quick review, no spoilers. Story 10/10It's based all around the premise of war, and the way the writer does it is so beautiful, everything flows so smoothly and leaves you theorising what's going to happen next - this is how a story should be.  The twists and turns in this seemingly simple story at first brings a new dimension to how beautifully writter it actually is.Art 10/10MAPPA did an amazing job, no questions. the transitions were so good (especially one in particular, regarding Sasha) were so beautiful. Just go see how it switches from flashbacks to reality, and how clean they made it. Thefight scenes are also beautiful and well executed.

Sound 10/10

Always 10/10, the OP and ED symbolises and portrays the story elegently, the war themed opening, and then the depressive ending where it feels like there is no hope, it's just...beautiful.

Character 9/10

Hmm... every character is important and plays a huge role, there isn't much here to say really without spoiling things, but the fact that there are 'minor' characters getting a lot of screentime should definately mean something.

Enjoyment 10/10

When the highlight of the week is a sunday waiting for the next episode to come out, then you know you're in love.

Overall 10/10

I'm going to go as far as saying, if i was to recommend an anime, it would be this. If i was to say which is the best anime out there, it would be this. This season in particular goes along the greats, such as code geass, cowboy bepop, one piece etc.",2021-03-19T07:02:00+00:00,10
"Art 8 : If you know that the studio is having hard time doing animation of this season, the quality is pretty good, and i'm sure that the quality will improve in BD version.Sound 9 : BGM is pretty cool, it's have the similiar terror as the previous composer Sawano Hiroyuki, Voice acting is great, Eren voice acting in this season is really cool,  also all the other cast.Character 7 : Sudden change and personality about Eren is the big problem that makes this arc feels really weird, his intentions is not clear which want to save his friends, eldians, or the entire world.Which makes the other character should pace up with Eren sudden changes.

Enjoyment 8 : Since the story is basically same as the manga, i would give score 8 for this arc. It feels pretty sudden, and the manga feels pretty rushed, i hope anime wont rushed it by giving more episodes to 25.

Overall 8,5 : The music and the voice acting saves this arc a lot, which still let me to give a 8 score which is high. Also the animation mostlikely will improve in BD version.


---------------------------------------------------
[Some additional notes]


This series is good, but as not as good to get 10 score for some reason

- The studio is having hard time to do as the deadline is very short, so in some episodes they having some trouble for animating it. (hope they improve it in BD)

- If this series is only having 16 episodes, they won't make it to the final chapter of the manga. Either they make part 2 and cliffhanging the series or going way trough to 25 episodes.

- Voice acting, sound is great. But the bgm is not as good as the previous season, which composed by Sawano Hiroyuki, but it's pretty good and not bad.

- There's a lot of plothole in this series, wonder if anime can fill it or Isayama will do it in extra series or something.

- If you read the manga, the last 3 chapter is disappointing, i won't spoil it. Unless Isayama told the studio to change the ending(or maybe make the pace more smoother), the score shouldn't able to reach 9 or 10.




Update : 

Honestly i hate the recent manga chapters (personal thought outside of score).
I think it's pretty rushed and need more chapter to build up the situation, i hope the anime can make it more enjoy to watch.

Please don't get butthurt because i didn't give a score of 10",2021-03-07T23:30:00+00:00,8
"I'm going to be honest I'm giving Aot a 10 but mappas work isn't a 10 for me. If I was true to what I feel of this season other than the story and stuff i would give it a 7/10. I was very optimistic about the studios swapping but well here am i being disappointed. I know what has happened and why it has happened, I'm still rating a 10 because of everything else other than cgi and the feeling this season gives.My thoughts and writing is all over the place but that's how i feel. I wish wit had kept the show ormappa getting more time, money, and resources of aot because mappa is a capable studio! I might change my scoring later on if something bad happends but honestly after ep 4 the chapter 100 moment which was the first time in my life crying of hype my disappointment feels overwhelming...idk, for now, i just hope they get time for animating the 2nd part of the final season.",2021-03-07T06:48:00+00:00,10
"I personally have no idea how you cannot like this. I respect people's opinions but I juts dont understand how. I personally do not like the mc ( Eren ) but I have to admit he's extreamly well written. Everyone in the show has its own complexity which I find really cool, the plot twists will leave you speechless and as I am queit a picky watcher I usually like when episodes end on a cliff hanger/suspense end because it you can say 'motivates"" me to watch the next episode and AoT is exactly that. I think the storyline and plot is very well thoughtout and written ( especially when AoT is Isayama's first manga ) I think this anime is the defination of ""Always expect the unexpected"". Overall I give this a 10/10 its an absolute masterpiece and you should 100% watch if you haven't",2021-03-01T01:54:00+00:00,10
"-- This review is a bit outdated, edit below --Look, a lot of diehard fans might crucify me for this, but this is my least favourite season of the whole series. The setting shifts drastically but that's the least of my complaints.I hate the animation, it's really choppy. MAPPA (or whatever the new studio is called) tries to do more realistic and vivid dialogue but it just looks like your video is stuttering. The 3D/CG art is just distracting, and doesn't have the charm of the 2D artstyle they used in Season 1-2. Season 3 was fine, since it didn't have (distracting) CG.I do likethe story and the character motivations here, and the fight scenes are as bloodpumping as always.

-- edit --
After seeing episode 13, things finally start to be interesting. I absolutely hated the first part of this season, but after the Marley attack, things became way more interesting and the art became better. No (distracting) CG bullshit, no shitty art and animation, just great AoT story-stuff.

I still wouldn't call this a masterpiece as all of the other reviews do, it really isn't. This season isn't worth a score of 10 at all, but it became more enjoyable and interesting.",2021-02-16T08:06:00+00:00,7
"Spoilers ahead for Attack on Titan, and I have not read the manga.Story: 10Attack on Titan started of as a simple yet intriguing story of a dystopian society in which humanities last survivors are forced to live inside of walls due to a larger predator, titans. The first season serves the purpose of introducing the world and its mysteries, and after that what seems to be a zombie story with a slight twist, becomes a complex story with political conflict both internal and external, developing interesting themes throughout, such as freedom, facism (particularly the friend and enemy distinction), racism and others. In the beggining, ourprotagonists fight for survival, a straightforward idea, that by most peoples standards is totally correct from a moral perspective. Not only that, but the government also uses this enemy as a means to ensure peace within the walls, preventing fighting between humans, since they are united towards this common foe. But, as the show progressess, the line between friend and enemy, good and evil, becomes indistinguishable, you find out humans can turn into titans, the government is keeping secrets from the people, and stoping their attempts at true freedom, and finally, you find out titans are actually inocent people, who had a cruel fate because of their human oppressors. Not only is the story interesting in itself, it is also executed to perfection through the use of foreshadowing and parallels. If you look back on the show, there is a lot of foreshadowing that most viewers probably missed on their first watch. Events that happened in season 4 were being hinted at in the first episode, this subtle foreshadowing is great for the show, since it is not enough to completely give away future events. but it isn't too little that it makes major plot twists seem cheap or ""asspulls"". Furthermore, parallels are used to show the moral ambiguity of the whole situation, without the need of the characters needing to say that, or getting exposition dumps and lectures on ethics.

Art: 9

The 2d scenes are amazing, they are fluid and the color palette helps the tone and atmosphere the show tries to convey. On the other hand, while the 3d animation isn't perfect, it is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be, it's true that on ep 6 the warhammer and attack titans looked slightly off, but this is fixed in ep 7. The jaw, cart and armored titans have looked great throughout, and the little we have seen of the colossal looks better than wits colossal (not to say wits animation was bad by any means, it was also great). 

Characters: 10

Seeing the growth of the main cast throughout the seasons has been great. You can definately see how everything they have gone through has changed them. Reiner serves as an amazing foil to Eren, as they have both been changed by the blurring lines between friends and enemies, albeit in completely opposite ways. Characters that had been fairly stagnant, such as Hange and Conny, are finally starting to develop more. Also, the interactions between characters have been amazing. This tough situation that our protagonists have been put through have really pushed their respective development, highliting everyones ideals, it has been extremely interesting to see everyones thoughts on the cycle of violence, and the nuances of the outside world.

Soundtrack: 10

The same bangers from the first 3 seasons, plus the new track ""ashes on the fire"". Each track does an excellent job at provoking the emotion it wants to, and setting the correct tone, furthermore, the timing at which each song has been played is impecable, and the selections have been just as good.

Tone: 10

Unlike other anime, AoT does a fantastic job at separating its serious sceanes from the lighthearted ones, the tone of the show becoming darker has not meant that funny interactions between characters have been comletely scraped, but they are moderate, and well placed, which serves to remind us that our protagonists, and the warriors/ candidates are all human, and that they want to be happy just as much as everyone. But, when the tone needs to be darker, it is executed perfectly, through dialogue, visuals, and music.

Overall, AoT is an anime that has just gotten better, a gift that keeps on giving, and it will definately not go down as a legendary modern classic just because of popularity, but also because of its amazing quality in every aspect, it is an amazing epic tale, with a sublime execution, as long as it sticks the landing in the final episodes of course. We will have to wait and see.",2021-02-15T15:39:00+00:00,10
"Attack on Titan was the first anime that I've ever seen. It wasn't too long ago to be honest, actually it was the year 2018 where I watched it and from that point forward, I was a big fan of anime. I never write reviews on this website because frankly, I am not a good writer nor a good ""critic"", but I think I'm going to make an exception for this one right here. Heads up!!!: I'm going to compliment the ever living sh*t out of this show so... yeah just so you know.Story: 9/10Let's start with the story and man what a great oneat that. It's not perfect but it's still pretty damn impressive how one person can come up with a story like this.
Believe me when I say that I've watched a lot of animes in these last couple of years. I've seen a lot of good ones, but also a handful of bad ones. I thought about this for a while... but I think that AOT has the best story in any anime ever made. A hot topic I know and please remember that I haven't seen every single anime or read every single manga on our beautiful blue planet. But when it comes to the animes that I've seen this far, AOT beats every single one of them with easy in the story department. AOT is just that kind of show, where it just feels great and fulfilling watching it from the start to the very end. For me personally the show never had a ""bad season"" or something like that because every time when you feel like the show is getting a little bit boring BOOM another season starts and there is just the right amount of difference in the story or the action to make the experience feel fresh, new and unique. There are so many twists and turns in the story that you never really know what's going to happen next. So you just watch every episode with anticipation thinking about what's going to happen... just to get punched in the face with another plot twist. Everyone that watched season 2 knows that episode 6 and 7 were probably some of the best episodes of the whole series. But the thing is, these are still only 2 episodes... believe me... there are so many other mind f*cks in this show it's baffling honestly. It doesn't help that I read the manga as well and oooooooooooohhhhh boy there are still a lot of ""What the f*ck?"" moments to come. Be prepared is all I'm going to say :-) I mentioned it to my friends a bunch, but this season just feels like the endgame of this show. All the years that I spent watching this show and seeing the characters grow and change is just really satisfying to see. It just feels like... the end you know. 

Characters: 10/10
But at the end, what is a good story without a great cast of characters?
Oh right... nothing. So how are the characters in AOT?
Well... pretty damn good.
The characters in this series are some of the most memorable characters in any piece of media that I've ever consumed. Just of the top of my head:
Reiner, Berthold, Annie, Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Levi, Connie, Jean, Sasha, Hange, Historia, Erwin, Zeke are the ones that come to my mind. There are still many more but it would take years to write them all down here and I think that wouldn't be fun to read sooooooooooo ;D
But as you can see, this series has a pretty full and stacked cast of characters. One of my favorite animes is Violet Evergarden. I love that show, but it has so many characters and people that are just uninteresting and straight up boring. AOT never had a problem like that. I mean sure, there are going to be characters that are more important than others and there's not going to be as much screen time for characters than for others too, but with that said, there still isn't a single individual in this series that I found boring or unnecessary. Every character served it's purpose.
And man, the character development is just crazy. You think you know who that character is and what they want to accomplish, but then something tragic happens, or at least something unexpected that completely messes everything up and you are left with a character who is completely different from the one you once thought of knowing so well. 

Art: 9/10
I think this one is probably a no-brainer. Wit Studio was responsible for the animation of the first 3 seasons and they did an amazing job. So, when the news came out that they switched the studios for the final season I'm not going to lie, I was a bit nervous. Mappa is the new studio for season 4 and they had to fill some pretty big shoes. But to my surprise... they nailed it. And I've seen a lot of people lashing out and making fun of the ""bad CGI"" in this season and it just baffles me. They're waaaaaaaaaaaaaay more animes out there with CGI that just look atrocious compared to the CGI in this season (*cough*Berserk 2016*cough*).
Look... I know that the best CGI is the kind of CGI that blends in and stays unnoticeable. Don't get me wrong, the CGI in this series is noticeable. BUT IT'S A: NOT THAT BAD, AND B: BARELY EVEN PRESENT. Most of this season is beautifully animated in 2D. It is also fascinating that there are a few rotoscoped scenes in this season and for the people that don't know what I'm am talking about: ""Rotoscoping is an animation technique which consists of tracing over actual real-life footage as reference"" (Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5dDG2dkm7Y). With that technique the animation looks gorgeously smooth and pretty at some points of the show. But talking about the CGI again, I think it looks great and I know this topic is a personal thing. If you think the animation is gawky/bad that's totally fine. But just please don't be like these retards who personally assault and threat the creators and animators of this show, when they clearly put their heart and soul into this.

Sound: 9/10
All of the openings are bangers and memorable. Most of the endings too with a few exceptions here and there. The sound effects are music to my ears. And the OST of the show is  
lovely and beautiful. Yeah that was pretty easy ;D

Overall: 10/10
To sum it all up, Attack on Titan is amazing in every sense of the word. The characters, story and animation are all phenomenal. The series as a whole isn't perfect, but most thinks aren't. But this series will always have a special place in my heart and I'm grateful that I started watching anime with this one. If someone reading this hasn't seen this show yet and is still unsure if he or she should start watching it then please watch the first 3 or so episodes of season 1 and you are going to be pleasantly surprised, I guarantee it :)

If you've read this review from start to finish, I really appreciate it! Thanks for spending your time reading this :-) This was my first review that I've ever written for anything so a big thank you for reading! &lt;3",2021-02-07T06:53:00+00:00,10
"Attack on Titan is the true meaning of a ""good anime"". From episode 1 of season 1 to the recent episode, what it gives us is ""enjoyment"". Everything in this anime is just too perfect to be true let it be the soundtrack, openings and endings, animation, story-line, plot and the characters, I honestly cannot point out one flaw in this anime. And the OST is just so damn good that i can literally listen to it till I die! The animation also is fantabulous, both Wit studio(season1- season 3) and MAPPA studios(season4) did a brilliant job animating it. The characters of this anime wereefficiently developed, especially Eren's character development was truly exceptional. This anime's plot itself was unique and the way the anime takes each and every episode was magneficent. Each and every episode makes us wanna know ""what happens next?"" and this curiosity just makes us have an inquisitive interest to watch the next episode. About the openings, i should say AOT has one of the most finest songs making me crave to hear em over and over again. Hats off to this miraculous man, Hajime Isayama for giving us such a fine Masterpiece! It kinda sounds like i'm over-exagerrating it but I'm NOT, this anime deserves more praise! I'm genuinely running out of words to tell how great this anime really is. The only one thing I dont like abt AOT is ""killing all our favourite characters"", let it be Erwin's death in season3 or the recent distress of Sasha's death, I say Isayama really enjoys us cry in misery after our favourite characters die, which is very cruel of you Isayama! 
I say if u still didn't start AOT then ""I DEMAND YOU TO START IT RIGHT AWAY IF YOU'RE A TRUE ANIME FAN!!!!""",2021-02-06T04:56:00+00:00,10
"This anime is just a perfect storm of everything I like and this final season so far has just been incredible. AoT in general also is one of the few anime that I feel like is perfectly adapted from the source material, perhaps made even better now that it has the benefit of sound, voice acting, and of course- animation. I binged the eight episodes that are currently out all in one night, it felt incredible. Also I really enjoy the opening as well, it feels and sounds good for the story they're telling this season in particular and gives me chills. I seriously cannotrecommend it enough, it's just so rad.",2021-02-05T12:14:00+00:00,10
"The character Gabi and the voice acting from Sakura, Ayane must be the worst I've seen and heard. The constant cliché scripting, the extreme overacting and overall cringe makes every scene with her unbearable, I've had to skip past her scenes but as she doesn't add anything to the story, not much is missed.Remove her and you got a decent start to a final season (although the introduction of these new kids and Episodes 1-5 were extremely confusing) but as others have pointed out countless times, it's in essence an overhyped show.Art & Fighscenes are as great as they've always been. Voice acting & charactersof the original are of high standard as they've been in previous seasons.

The darker theme &amp; character fits Eren very well.",2021-02-02T05:01:00+00:00,6
"I mean how can I express my love for this anime... I watched its first season during lockdown on my friend's recommendation ... He was just non stop babbling about Attack on Titan .. At that time I was like ok whats the big deal... But then when I watched the first season I was hooked to the anime rather its be its story, characters ,animation , most importantly soundtrack..For a lot of time I have been watching anime ... I know I havent watched that much but still the Attack On Titan series is just so good!!!....This anime for me is just a masterpieceby Isayama .... The way story unfolds is just incredible... Unpredictable...but still relatable to the viewer as this show emphasis on how incidents in life change your mental state ... I have no words on how much I love this anime ... And if you are an anime lover just please do watch this legendary series and just like Gigguk said.... This is the anime which defines our generation...❤️",2021-02-01T03:36:00+00:00,10
"Attack on Titan has various things because of which it's deemed as a masterpiece by many. One of those things is the heavy realism. What looks like a horror fantasy quickly changes its tone and becomes a realistic, modern, pre war setting, psychological drama anime. The duality of freedom and the causes and consequences of long borne hatred are perfectly depicted.The way the characters interact with others, react to situations, all of it is done extremely well. Fighting for freedom, oppression of a race, politics, war, ask for anything and AoT provides it to you.One of the most important things is the narration and storytelling. The amount of foreshadowing and how every piece of mystery connects them together at the end, just makes one wanna wonder about the depth of the plot.

Growth of characters, Eren grew up from being a naive and revenge thirsty person to someone who understands the world more than anyone.

Upto E5 the adaptation has been faithful with very less skips from the source. I would like to write much more but that'd be spoiling for anime onlies.

With that being said now I can claim AoT Final Season to be 10/10 masterpiece.",2021-01-31T11:24:00+00:00,10
"Basically all i want to say is that this anims is top tier shonen powerI watched through Season 1 and it was good but rushed idk. Although i want more but still introducing the characters and the battle between Eren and Annie at the end was awesome but not too awesome that muchBut until Season 2 too, things got i say ""Slower but with more storytelling and a bit more action"". Everything was so fast i couldn't keep up especially during the finale where Eren faced Reiner and Levi first seeing the Beast Titan but didn't fought it. It was cool and goodBut and imean BUT until Season 3 Part 1, things got very slow, there just talking instead of action, the Scouts basically trying to get Historia to Queen but have to get Eren back from the father of the Reiss family. I say that was good but feel kinda slow.

Then Season 3 Part 2 came up and it was and I mean it: WAS VERY TOP TIER. Levi facing the Beast Titan himself and the battles were just out of this world. Eren facing Reiner for the second time was already enough for me and then the end where Zeke telling Eren he will find and rescue him that was amazing.

And now we reach here, the final Season of AOT. I have to admit the first 4 episodes was good but not until Episode 6 came up then we got bombed with ton of action and trash talk. So Episode 7 was the current episode honestly i felt shocked watching this episode.

Overall everyone who thinks this anime and this series in total bad then you go suck your butt to the door or i go kill your soul. I love this series so much right now",2021-01-30T22:31:00+00:00,10
"This is the most excited I've ever been while watching any anime. I've loved all of attack on titan so far and this is so far shaping up to be the best season. As usual the music and sound design has been perfect so no complaints there. I generally don't like any CGI in animes but MAPPA did a great job with it. The CGI isn't gonna be as good as traditional hand drawn animation buuuut it's not noticeably bad enough in the scenes where it's used to hurt the shows quality overall unless you're super nit picky. As long as they can get pastthe finish line with the same quality enjoyment its had so far then this season and the whole show are a 10/10 for me. If you've enjoyed AOT seasons 1-3 then so far at least, season 4 will not disappoint you.",2021-01-30T20:32:00+00:00,10
"I started watching since the first episode coming out, and when I was up to episode 6, I decided to express my thoughts, for this masterpiece.At the beginning I would like to thank the studio MAPPA very much, about that did not disappoint me if not snag the details..... ok lets startOP intro 10/10 - if i compared to the previous ones then the first time looked like crap, but after several episodes it got better and better, don't know why it reminded me from one tv series called Black Sails, myself do not understand what but it is.Story - Its final season, its afinal battle anything can happen here, I honestly like how it all started, but I do not know where it will end.

Art 10/10 - watching trailer they seemed to draw worse, then WIT studio, but on the show it looks just as good as WIT,than 4 years have passed + maybe just the contrast changes, in general, I am satisfied with everything.


Sound 10/10 - I don't particularly hear the difference, Hiroyuki Sawano and others just keep blowing up slowly with new osts.


Character 10/10 - 1-4 episodes I watched and sympathized with all those who did not live on the island, met new heroes with their problems.
5-7 Later I started to get confused and don't know who is good and bad, remains difficult to watch, but knowing what Eren and his people have survived,
its like World War II. 


Enjoyment 10/10 - starting with the 6th series, you understand that it is impossible to return or drop.


Overall 10/10- I keep watching and hope for the best




Bonus- I hope it will..... NO! it will happen TOP Anime rank 1 will gonna be AOT final season.",2021-01-29T10:39:00+00:00,10
"This anime, being one of the most hyped and overall greatest experiences for a watcher is easily a top 5 must-watch for any fan of any kind of media. Not only is it nearly perfectly adapted from the manga, being the voice acting, music, fluidity, and style of the animation, the timeline of the story leads to incredible heights of serotonin rushing my veins through every second of the show. I could watch it over and over. New episodes are not only blowing up the internet weekly but seeing as what is to come from MAPPA's perfected season of this anime is something to notonly be excited about but is one for the history books in terms of greatest media of all time.",2021-01-25T11:05:00+00:00,10
"I will say this first.This is NOT the greatest TV show ever made, or the greatest anime ever made. It's amazing, for sure, but for the overall quality of the 4th Season, some people are hyping it up way too much. Of course, this works the other way around. Some people are claiming that it is hot garbage and a poor adaptation, and are actually attacking MAPPA and the staff, which is a) wrong and b) very disrespectful.Now, let's actually get into the review.Story: 10Attack on Titan has some of the most consistently mind-blowing writing I have ever witnessed in my life, and that trendcontinues in season 4. No scene is there without a reason, no piece of dialogue misplaced. The pacing is excellent, and the worldbuilding continues to impress. There's a lot to say about the writing, and I won't go into too much detail here, but just know that the story is incredible.

Art: 8

MAPPA's work IN MY OPINION is a slight downgrade from WIT's insanity. I don't think people realize just how good WIT's visuals were. That being said, MAPPA is still doing a fine job executing the fight scenes. It knows exactly where to use its budget, just like MAPPA. I personally enjoy the new art style, as it sticks closer to the manga.

Sound: 8

I'm no expert on sound, but here are some of my opinions anyways. I dislike the opening. I love the new music they used during the Warhammer vs Eren fight. I like the trailer music. I was okay with the theme they used during Eren's transformation.

Character: 9

Eren is GOATED.

Besides him, I really like Reiner's progression. He has cemented himself as one of my favorites. The Warriors and the candidates are all interesting, especially Zeke. 

I dunno. We just got introduced to a buttload of new characters, and it's hard to judge only 6 episodes in, but I like what I have seen.

Enjoyment: 10

Season 4 has no shortage of scenes that make you feel like you just had a dozen biohazard coffees after smoking a 10-pack of Arturo Fuente Anejo (not that I've ever done that). The amount of adrenaline episodes 5 and 6 alone have induced in me is mind-boggling. And I'm sure there's more to come. I have been having an absolute blast with this one.

Overall: 9

It doesn't really have a flaw. Unless you want to count the animation and soundtrack as 'flaws', even though they're quite strong in their own right. It's great. it's amazing. Go watch it. What are you doing, reading this review when you could be watching AoT S4? Oh, you've watched it already? Well, do it again.",2021-01-21T01:55:00+00:00,9
"Attack on Titan *ANIME* season 1 to season 3 part 2 was great but now it is history. Season 4 so far is a utter disappointment and here is whyArt: The trailer looks amazing but when the actual anime came out, it turned  out otherwise. The introduction of the CGI titans that looks like it is cropped out from video games is already bad enough but wait that is not the worst. the worst is that in episode 6 they decided to intro CGI corps and that is the last straw. The glory feeling we get from titan transformations and smooth corps movements havedisappeared into oblivion due to how cheap it looks now.

Music and OST: lets be honest here, it isn't as good as the previous seasons as the studio do not have enough time to make perfect adjustments for it

Story and Character: Now the anime series is purely carried by the great plot and character development/backstory of the series. There is hardly anything to criticize AOT about when it comes to the plot and characters. 

Enjoyment: It is hard to watch so far as AOT is an action anime and action scenes is badly expressed due to the CGI's slow movement and lack of impact.

I do not blame the animators that worked their hardest for the series but i blame the producers/higher ups of the studio that decided to rush the series because of their greed since the hype for AOT is all time high right now.",2021-01-20T21:33:00+00:00,5
"For me snk the final saison is for the momment perfect (épisode 6) in the first épisodes they are many buildup for the épisode 5 and 6 we are presented with very endearing characters deliberately reminding us of Eren Mikasa and Armin from previous seasons to finally show us it is only a war that there are no good guys or bad guys just a war we are also shown during the buildup episodes that I told you about at the start of the rewiew, the exterior of the walls which reminds us of today's world by evoking themes such as racism now were gonnatalk about the animation for me she is tunning the CGI is overall successful but they are small passages with very poor quality CGI but most of the time we are offered the best of the animation overall the animation is a succes 
the sound was unbelivable for exemple ""my war"" or the OST was memorable and please stop all the time wanting an epic OST
overall this season 4 of snk is for the moment perfect",2021-01-19T10:07:00+00:00,10
"It is finally the time. Attack on Titan is back with its final season and it raises adrenaline once again. However, this time with a new studio behind its production. Wit Studio did such a great job with last seasons so I was really sceptic and worried what would happen to the series without them, but I am positively surprised. STORY - 10 -------------->I cannot get into much details about the plot. I can only mention that when compared to this season, the previous ones come off as a peaceful yet bumpy journey. The old team of Survey Corps soldiers, great as ever, albeit thistime in a slightly altered form. Everyone are adults and we can explore their inner feelings even more detailed than before.  What all seasons have in common (Final Season as well) is that, as usual, the viewer must be prepared for a sharp dose of emotions and surprising twists along the way. 

ART - 8
-----------&gt;
When I found out that MAPPA will be producing this anime, I was relieved as MAPPA is capable of doing crazy magic when it comes to drawings and animation. However, probably due to the lack of time, strict deadlines or other issues, there is (sadly) CGI present. Don't get me wrong, its quality is rather fine but not amazing. Titan models are looking good enough to be watched with pleasure and all their flaws are cleverly concealed behind smokes, explosions and other action-driven elements. You might ask, so what's wrong with it? Typical problem of CGI is weird stutter movements which are of course present here, but that's not the main issue. The worst thing so far is in the sixth episode in which the Survey Corps soldiers appear. Scenes with their 3D models are one of the most hilarious and immersion-destroying moments. I burst out laughing when I saw the character looking around in slow-motion kind of way.  

Apart from CGI, 2D art is wonderful. I am only anime-watcher so I don't know if the style is correct when it comes to comparison with original manga, but I find MAPPA's art as the perfectly fitting with this season's dark tone. When looking at the drawings you can actually feel the sadness and all other inner feelings of the main heroes.  

SOUND - 9 
--------------&gt;
As usual, Attack on Titan does not disappoint when it comes to audio. The opening, although different from the previous ones, is in a class of its own, as is the ending. A rousing opening, combined with a calm ending is a perfect combination. The music played during the action scenes raises the adrenaline level and sometimes the complete lack of music makes this anime a pleasure to watch. 

CHARACTERS - 10
------------------------&gt;
As mentioned above in the story section, just when you think these characters can't get any more developed, this season comes in with even more power and surprises. 

ENJOYMENT - 10 
------------------------&gt;
At the time of writing this review, the series hasn't ended yet, but I can be sure that after these few episodes it can only be better and better (although it's almost perfect already). Not many anime is able to put the viewer on the edge of his seat and make the 20-minute episode seem like 5 minutes. 

OVERALL - 10
------------------&gt;
Attack on Titan: The Final Season is an absolute must-watch for any anime-watcher out there. Although there are few flaws and issues, you have to watch it no matter what. The story is breath-taking and has a perfect pacing. The music, the animation, the characters, everything works together like a clockwork. One of the most mature and wonderfully written stories out there.",2021-01-18T04:53:00+00:00,10
"Story : 10This is SNK, so  yeah, the story is great. So far, I love the story, even if we don't see much about our guys, we still learn a lot and the hype is there.Art 6 : The animation could be better but what hurts the most is the design of Mikasa (the short hair, apparently it's like this in the manga but still, why :'( And she doesn't look like what she used to ...). Basically, the new characters are really cool but the old ones look like time was cruel with them ... Sound 8 : Nothing mind-blowing but still verygood, nothing to say. Some argued that the OST for the fifth episode was terrible, I don't agree. 

Character 7 : Yeah the new characters are cool and all but ... I want to see the batallion's point of view, how they developped during those years. We can't be that attached to characters we've only seen for 6 episodes ... 

Enjoyment 10 : I'm a huge fan so every sunday I'm basically trembling as I wait for the episode to come out. I'm so hyped by this anime.

Overall 8 : We could have waited one or two years more and have WIT (or Mappa with more time, maybe) to have it done perfectly. SNK deserves the best that exists, it's sad to think what it could have been ... But still, more than a good anime, watch it folks. If you have followed it since S1 and are not a manga reader, then the note should be near 10.",2021-01-18T00:54:00+00:00,8
"We have finished the first part of season four of Shingeki No Kyojin. One of them didn't make me so strong to adore the animation series from Mappa, honestly I liked the animation from the Wit studio more, but now in the last episodes they have repaired it.[Story, Characters, Soundtrack]The story is exceptional, I have nothing to comment on, even if some sequences have been slightly modified, it still remains. The characters kind of ruined Mikasa here in season 4 and it's sad what to say about Levi in ​​the first episodes he was a bit fat (my opinion) but they fixed it on theepisode that was passing (I repeat my opinion), I have nothing to say about Eren oy I made mua especially how this ador behaves to him, Sasha oy how could I not say anything about her that tail was created great oy. The soundtrack I can't complain about at all is perfect without mistakes but the only thing I don't like is the opening compared to seasons 1-3 this is a little bad but it works a bit.

[Personal Opinion]
The only weird thing is that every time I watched Anime it seemed like the episode was going too fast than the other seasons. This was very weird, but we can't complain about it. Everyone feels different.

Some friends told me that season 4 no longer makes sense, but I don't understand how they watched the anime because seasons 1-3 connect with season 4 very well, that's something I didn't always understand how they understood anime- ul, or maybe it's because they forgot from the beginning otherwise they don't understand.

I liked the story the most in this series and I started to like Sasha more than Mikasa and how some of the characters became, you can't even believe it's that character.

So my short opinion and note is: Extraordinary 9/10 series (because I didn't like some things)",2021-11-10T09:05:00+00:00,7
"For everything before this season(1-3):Wasn't really good in my opinion i watched it because my friends told me it was good and worth the watch, boy were they wrong. I wasn't a fan of how the story was progressing. Basically just a flesh mecha anime. Nicely animated but other than that it was tough to watch. Levi is an over rated character with very little positives. Same with Eren, he is a character with very little reason for his actions and has little motivation. Sorry for those of you who like the show, but it just isn't my cup of tea.",2021-10-19T10:30:00+00:00,4
"SPOILER FREE VERSIONShingeki No Kyoujin is a an anime that I honestly think is going to be one of the masterpieces of our time. It has its flaws -- no doubt -- such as falling victim to some of the oh-so-old shonen troupes, however its pros make them pretty much negligible. Especially the plot twists; they are so good that it almost felt as if the anime jumped genres (and that's not even an exaggeration). SPOILER VERSIONThe incredibly twists where it went from Reiner and Bertholdt's reveal of their identity (the casual way they did it was amazing -- and weirdly enough, it also madesense.) to the reveal of a city outside of the ones they lived in, and a world that is actually making use of titans really does kick this anime into cliche shounen to masterpiece territory. 
P.S Levi -- more like, his reliable atmosphere -- is still a wonder to see. *wipes mouth*",2021-08-26T16:58:00+00:00,10
"story is good, to be expected from the manga. this season tho is kinda trash tho no cap. no honest man will say the cgi is as good as the 2d art from s1-s3p2, and tbh even after the notorious colossal titan episode in s3p2 i didn't even notice it was a big thing because of the other phenomenal animation happening in the rest of the episode. in short: meh.redditors will say otherwise and praise the animation for what it is but bro, i do not care. i do not care about the backstory behind developing the animation. i understand that the animators were putin horrible working conditions; its not mappa's fault for such a short deadline, but regardless, looking at it as a final product from just the anime standpoint, there is very little room for discussion to praise this season that highly.",2021-07-18T15:06:00+00:00,5
"Well produced season, there are many turning points (a lot in the beggining of the season) that makes you want keep watching, still i prefered to watch it while it was been published (the wait of a week really hiped me up). Story line very interesting, i m still waiting the last season 2nd part to understand some catches of the old seasons. I didn t enjoyed fully the art beacause i thought that in some point it looked as it had low frame rate (small scenes but it s easily noticible as it usually runs smoothly). Also i thought that the SGI (i thinkit s called like this) wasn t done as good as i hoped, good thing is these issues appeared only few times.
For the sounds compartment i m not an expert, but i thought that the themes were nicely done... Only thing is the italian dubbed version is quite hideous, dubbed without emphasis, expecially Falco voice...[my opinion (i didn t watch the original)].
Characters are well done, in this season they are grown very much as some of them aren t even recognizable.
Overall my favourite season... it isn t action packed as the first but it s the most rich plot speaking.",2021-07-11T09:21:00+00:00,9
"What an amazing and perfect season my favorite so far it was just something unbelivable Story 10/10 The reveal of the world came and its the most interesting reveal in anime history its really deep and the talks were just perfect I never felt bored they were amazing.Art 9/10 Everything is perfect specially characters design really good cgi but some really bad frames in episode 6 and 7 everything else is perfect. Sound 10/10 My favorite sound tracks are in this season so epic man people who say ashes on fire was overused it was used 3 or 4 times only stop the cap. Andits already amazing.
Character 10/10 
Wow just impressive the development of the characters was amazing and some from he best written characters were introduced.
Enjoyment 10/10 
Is this even a question like imagine not enjoying aot lmao 
Overall 10/10 everything was perfect just the two or 3 frames of
The really bad CGI everything else is 10/10",2021-05-20T17:07:00+00:00,10
"Wow...If I knew how much the phrase ""Give up your hearts"" would mean in the this season compared to the last one.I know I won't be able to express how much my love for this anime, and especially this season is, but, i'll try my best.Season 4 started off as a mystery to me, since I was an ""anime-only"" when I started watching the 4th season. These 4 kids were on screen and the whole time I was like ""who the hell are they?"" it took about 15 minutes in to realize I was in for a hell of a ride. First and foremost, themost obvious change in this season was the change in animation. While most of the fandom had not liked it, I absolutely loved it. More detail in the expression on their faces, more shading on the smallest part in the environment.. Animation is one of the main factors I take into account as I begin watching an anime, and I was not disappointed with this season's artwork. As I kept watching, I was wondering where the characters we know and love were, and when they were finally revealed, I was astounded. Throughout the whole anime, I was made to believe there was one set enemy; the people beyond the walls. Season 4 completely changed my perspective and made me realize the true enemy was the person standing right in front of them. I had stuck with this anime since the  very beginning and seeing my favorite characters grow into who they are now.. there was a sense of pride. The sound was perfect as well. In some key moments the sound used perfectly captured the tension, stress, and even sadness of the moments on screen, and I felt like I was there myself, having to go though what the characters had gone though. I was on the edge of my seat for every episode, like the millions of people watching, waiting for ""AOT Sunday"".  The hype was there online, and when season 4 was announced, we were all ready to welcome the beginning of the end. If I were given the chance, I would forget this anime and watch it as if I never knew about it. Safe to say this is my favorite anime I have ever come across, and nothing will top it. At least, not for now.

Overall, its giving very much anime of the year once again.

Thank you, Hajime Isayama, for an anime we will never forget. &lt;3",2021-05-11T08:22:00+00:00,10
"Quick thoughts:Wow. Can't say I completely understood what happened, but this was still one of the most enjoyable seasons of anime I've watched in a while.Story:I think the story was told pretty well. It's a straightforward timeline with a few short flashback arcs when additional context was needed. I was a bit confused in the first couple episodes, but I think that was mostly due to me forgetting some details between seasons. I liked how there wasn't a clear cut good or bad side being pushed; they present the motives and thought processes of several characters and seem to leave it to the viewer tointerpret. Assuming part 2 of this season will be of similar length, I thought this season ended at a good point.

Art:
I thought a lot of the still shots were pretty good. They did especially well in capturing negative emotions through facial expressions; I could really feel the fear or disgust displayed through some of the characters. I think my main gripe would be some of the CGI. It usually looked fine, but there were a few scenes where sudden drop/change in frame-rate would take me out of the moment.

Sound:
Outside of the OP, I didn't find much of the music to be memorable. The voice acting was solid, don't remember anyone sounding out of place.

Characters:
I thought the characters were great overall. I initially thought some developments were jarring (Eren mostly), but i eventually found their changes to be understandable. I did find one character annoying (Gabi), but I think that was partially by design. She did do well in showing how the people under similar influences and conditions would view the world; It would've been tough to make someone with her role likable. Everyone else was solid though. I really liked how well feelings like uneasiness, distrust, etc. were displayed through the cast.

Enjoyment:
As someone who wasn't the biggest fan AoT up to this point, I really did enjoy this season. Any negatives I've mentioned so far are vastly overshadowed by how engaging I found the animation and action to be, and how interested I was in seeing what would result from the conflict in morals among the main cast.",2021-05-02T09:15:00+00:00,9
"In fact, this season is better than past seasons. The characters will be revealed in the second part of the season, so I won't write anything about it. I paid more attention to the sound this season, and therefore it seems to me that the creators coped perfectly with the sound coincidence (the opening is gorgeous)But the main problem is that ""MAPPA"" are the most talantless people in the world. And I'm not even talking about 3D titans, I mean the combat animations, color grading and faces themselves. All of this looks just awful compared to previous seasons. And even the trailer in the styleof past seasons looks much better.",2021-04-23T01:16:00+00:00,6
attack on titan is very mainstreme and i think thats one of its strong points and is the first anime i have ever actaully seen. but the more i watch the more i grow to dislike the characters and the story. i want to finish it to see why everybody thinks its the second coming of christ but i cant even make it half an episode before i get really bored and drop it. the fights are fun and so is the soundtrack but i feel like the characters are not that good. it seems like there no character development and going from sakura tosasuke over the cours of season 3 to 4 i feel like does not really count. now i do think its good but i feel like it dropped the ball on the final season and its way to overhyped.,2021-04-17T18:08:00+00:00,5
"Attack on titan is one of those shows where when you finish it you'll sit back and think. Just think. You'll keep thinking. The themes, the actions, the characters, the story all just made me think as I read chapter to chapter and watched episode to episode.When the story is ultimately wrapped up from anime watchers, they'll ask others where they can find anime's such as this one. I do this all the time as well as stories I enjoy, I want to see again and again and again. Usually it's simple, if you watched a great rom-com, you can find other rom-coms pretty easily.If you like action, then action is pretty easy to find. If someone asks me what to watch after Attack on titan I will just say breaking bad, not because the themes are similar, or the characters, or even the medium but rather because these 2 shows are the epitome of fiction. They have some of the highest peaks in all of TV, think Hero in AOT and Ozymandias in Breaking Bad. 

Animation: 8/10
The animation was a step back from Wit's sharp line, hand drawn titans that made them pop. One of my favorite fights in the whole series is the clash of titans in episode 7 of season 2. HOWEVER, the cg models used are nothing short of top-tier. Seriously, the armored, jaw and even the cart titan all had amazing action sequences. I can't think of one ""bad"" model with the rest looking generally pretty good. 

Story: 10/10
This is Attack on Titan, you already know it's good.

OST(9/10):
Now there's really only 1 song that I can remember of the top of my head which is Ashes of the Fire but that's my favorite track in the whole series so that's why this is a 9/10.

Characters(10/10)
I love this cast, but seeing the dead, anguished and tired look on their faces helps to understand the brutality of war.",2021-04-15T09:12:00+00:00,10
"Attack on Titan is a rare show that causes me to break the traditional mold I have in my reviews (senseless trolling, humor-filled misconceptions, endearing opinions of an enlightened individual in a community of idiots) in order to write something more grandiose and impactful.  Objectively, Attack on Titan is a masterpiece of entertainment; it is inadequate to view it as anything less given its rampant success. Ishiyama has proven time and time again that he is the king of storytelling with his wonderful use of pacing and plot development. With MAPPA, a world-renown studio producing the final season, I'm left to wonder - whoeven bothers scrolling through these reviews? We all know it's fucking amazing, go watch it. 

Anyways, I've seen some serious mind-boggling contrarians plaguing this forum, so I'm going to detail some senseless complaints about this show (and why they're wrong)!

A common complaint against Attack on Titan is that [this season in particular] suffers from bad CGI. My brain physically has difficulty processing this statement. For some reason, Giganerds get their panties in a twist when their Chinese cartoons attempt to cut production fees. Baseless spergs claim that ""bad CGI"" ruins the realism of this show - yet, this show isn't live action, or realistic. Rationality leaves you to conclude that they have brain damage, or alternatively, that they rely far too much on Anime for escapism from their lives. In reality, these individuals tend to be incredibly obnoxious and have a high opinion of how they digest films. I tend to find that any CGI in Anime is generally considered irredeemable to this demographic. What is particularly saddening about this, is that these individuals generally have zero legitimate reasons for why CGI detracts from the animation. While this can be entirely subjective, I have witnessed initial pleasing reactions to CGI scenes only for a contradicting (negative) opinion to resonate within the viewer once the CGI is noticed. Furthermore, like a light switch, I have seen the worthwhileness of scenes be solely judged on if they were animated using CGI or not. This is a unsagacious argument to make and should be disregarded as such. One counterargument I have heard was to raise the framerate of CGI objects to make them less jarring to the viewer. Even if we downplay how retarded that is from a technological perspective, it ironically demonstrates how little these people understand animated mediums as a whole. Projects like The Hobbit prove that this is illogical, but this isn't the answer these people are looking for. It is reasonable to assume that these individuals cannot find sustenance in a medium that contains CGI - and therefore - should not be trusted at all to devise a logical opinion on said medium. Individuals that rely on harping on something so minute in a project as grand as Attack on Titan will arguably miss the finer points of what makes Attack on Titan so great. So, in conclusion, if you hear an audible groan when CGI is used -- sympathize, for we cannot imagine the despicable lifestyle that one would have to lead to be so invested in something so inconsequential. We can only pray that eventually their life will move on from meaningless bickering, to something that gives joy.


Another (predictable) complaint I have heard is that this season is an absolute snore fest. Once again - we are left to think critically. Season four of Attack on Titan has answered a lot of questions shrouded in mysteries behind the series. Rightfully so, the lore is explained to give these questions the answers they need; consequently, the stakes are raised to unprecedented levels. Characters once perceived as nothing more than mere plot armor become fleshed out and given meaning. Personally, I found this to be the most riveting season of Attack on Titan yet - seeing Eren move from an emotional, irrational child to a ruthless genocidal revolutionist is as dynamic as a character can get. Furthermore, additional characters paint a stark comparison between the radicalization of Eren; the unchanging motives of Mikasa and Armin feel antiquated, while the hypocrisy of Gabi's ideals make you sympathize with what Eren does. This clashing of ideals is far more interesting than any of the generic action Attack on Titan can possibly bring - and it's what the fanbase craves. Arguably so, the plot is a beautiful symphonic melancholy; undoubtedly Ishiyama's magnum opus. It is unfortunate that certain people find it dull - because their deadbeat brain requires them to experience senseless action for dopamine, they will probably never be able to fully comprehend the genius that went into the writing of this story. 

And lastly, there is an unprecedented amount of investment into romantic relationships when there is none to be found in Attack on Titan. I don't understand why people bother entertaining anything as senseless as shipping characters from this show, when the show is the antithesis to romance to the core. I am the king of Harem anime; I've watched it all - and even I never considered the romantic aspect of this show. God help all of you.",2021-04-07T05:22:00+00:00,10
"When S3P2 ended, I couldnt hold myself back and started reading the manga. And you can imagine my confusion which was the same as anime viewers. When did this show become so dark and so amazing. AoT certainly ups its level and still the best of it is yet to come. The characters are amazing, the music is chilling, the art is beautiful and the story is cream of the crop. When there's a show which makes you feel honoured that you watch anime, the show then transcends everything.Although its not without faults as the rushed schedule sticks out like a sore thumb but thehype and story carry it easily. The pacing is a bit weird as sometimes it goes too fast and sometimes it pauses. Some of the manga moments arent that epic like Tatakae and the Jacket Scene. But by God the music is some of the best Ive heard. Ashes on Fire is a bit overused but that blame goes to Issayama as there are way too many epic moments.

This season was definitely peak fiction in terms of how mature the story telling was. It never held back any punches and Shinzo wou Sasagayeyo felt so different. Every minute is spent thinking what is going on and in a good way and at the end with the ed, you can only reflect on the rollercoaster of events that took place.

Needless to say it has the best OP of all time and the most hype reveals. The season ended right at the start of the payoff the entire season was building up to as well as the best arc in all of fiction. Damn this show brought me to tears.

So if you know anyone whos idea of anime is that its a kidish show, show them this and make them a Yeagerist",2021-04-06T10:50:00+00:00,10
"Generally exciting, though the dialogue is often clumsily and laboriously handled. Brief moments of humour tend to fall flat and the plot is quite convoluted and not the easiest to follow. That's both a good and bad thing, for it's a deep and multifaceted show which doesn't collapse into the hackneyed formula of good and evil, and as such it's highly nuanced and refreshingly perspectival. At the same time, some will find it hard to really have a grasp on what's happening and might get frustrated and bogged down in all the painstakingly laborious attempts to paint the narrative through lengthy dialogues.As for the animation:a lot has been said about it, but especially on second viewing, after adjusting to the jarring changes, I found the MAPPA animation to be superior to the WIT animation in many ways. There is more movement and detail for the most part, and the combat involving titan vs titan is generally more fluid and engaging. However, the heights found in the work of Arifumi Imai in, for example, the [will not spoil] in Pain, Season 3, is nowhere to be found in season 4. In general, combat which involves the ODM Gear isn't as dynamic and thrilling as in seasons 1-3. The rotoscoping experiments in season 4 sat well on second viewing, and can certainly be evolved going forward for a fully natural experience which escapes the uncanny valley, whether by conditioning and exposure or through it simply being executed much more seemlessly. But I dearly miss the utterly resplendent art of the skies which seasons 1-3 are so replete with.


I wouldn't say this is great, but definitely worth the watch — though obviously I say this under the assumption one has seen the previous seasons. 

Well --- enjoy, then.",2021-04-03T22:51:00+00:00,8
"Alright Review time. I am gonna make it clear, I am not the person that write a whole essay for review so i am gonna make it quick.Story- 10Art- 8 ok this is definitely a step down for the animation. Some frames looks weird and some characters frames was inconsistency. I get it Mappa had only been given 8 months for the season but for 8 months its very impressive, but for overall it's inconsistency.Sound- 9love the op and ending no problem hereCharacters- 10Enjoyment - 10Overall - 9For me Aot is perfectly rated the only thing that disappointed me was the Animation as well asthe cg. I highly recommand watching the show.",2021-04-02T00:24:00+00:00,9
"IAmAPest Reviews: Shingeki no Kyojin: Final Season, animated by MAPPA Studios(WARNING: Minor spoilers for the first three seasons of Attack on Titan)It's been one hell of a ride with Attack on Titan, that's for sure. After an amazing three seasons, many fans were speculating about its future with WIT exchanging hands with MAPPA, and for good reason, too. With this being the most anticipated season of AOT by far, they had some really big shoes to fill. As it is in my top 3 anime of all-time, just bear with me as I just jerk the dick of AOT during this review.Story 10/10  Nosurprise here, really. Attack on Titan has always had an amazing narrative, and nothing is different about that here. After the big reveal of the basement and the clear changes happening to the plot and Eren's character, a 4-year time skip happens, and that's where we start off in this final season. It may confuse some viewers, because the first few episodes are all entirely dedicated to Marley and the characters associated with it. A few interesting ones are added, like the Warrior Candidates, especially Falco and Gabi, who I will go into more detail later in this review. After we learn a lot about Marley, the pacing turns lightning-fast as shit really starts to hit the fan. I can't really say much else without going into spoiler territory, but what transpires is some of the best storytelling that has happened in this show thus far (considering that this is AOT, that says a lot). Bear in mind, though, that you won't see the Scouts for a few episodes, but it's for understandable reasons. Essentially, this plot is a thrill ride, with many shocking twists and turns and a couple of very emotional scenes, particularly one that left me enraged, not because it was bad, but because that was my response to it instead of sadness. I mean, what else can I say besides saying this is some great writing, as is expected out of AOT now.

Art 9/10 MAPPA has gotten a lot of extremely unnecessary flak with how they dealt with the animation. I admit that, at first, it takes a bit to get used to the new art style, as it is vastly different from WIT's. However, it's identical to the manga and it fits really well to the dark tone this season presents compared to the three before it. I really enjoy certain aspects of the new character designs, such as the dark shadows that are drawn around the eyes to show effects of fatigue, shock, anger, etc. Also, since the main cast are all adults now, they all look pretty different, but very good, too. Jean's and Connie's new designs are among my favorites. And, for the love of f***, Mikasa looks awesome, too. There's literally not a single thing wrong about her new look, especially since it matches her character and the events that are going on now. Due to the time constraints on MAPPA, they turned to CGI to animate a lot of the titans, and they received a LOT of critics about it. The CGI can look a bit off-putting, at times, especially at the first episodes, where it seemed MAPPA was still trying to recreate WIT's art style in their own way. Afterwards, though, there isn't anything wrong with it. I'd even say the CGI is better than WIT's, as they match the 2D environments well. The fight scenes are pretty phenomenal, as well, especially anytime Eren or Levi is involved in them. While I do believe there were a couple of shortcomings with the animation, it doesn't, by any means, dip the overall quality of the show.

Sound 10/10: Attack on Titan has my favorite soundtrack in all of anime, and it carries over here. While you won't find the same epic soundtracks from the last three season, you will find either recreations of them or entirely new orchestral epic pieces that matches all the ones we've heard up until this point. Hiroyuki Sawano, the composer of every season of AOT, is just a genius with the pieces that he has made for this show. Like, I honestly could listen to any track that was made by him on my way to a class or whenever. Besides the OSTS, the new opening is a certified banger. At first, I wasn't too into it, but after a while, I was rocking out to it like it was Shinzo wo Sasageyo. I'm just really happy that the soundtracks still stayed consistent throughout this last season, as it did in the last three.

Character 10/10: Eren's character, alone, makes this a 10/10 for me. I don't want to spoil much about him, but he is an entirely different person from what he was. He seems to abandon everything in order to achieve freedom for Eldians, even if it means he has to become a villain in order to achieve that. He's not even an anti-hero, at this point. On the side of Marley, he's probably the most evil person to walk the earth. You'll probably end up disliking him, even, but I think that's part of the point here. His character gets a LOT deeper than the way I am describing him here, but I highly encourage y'all to find that out on your own to just see the genius behind him now. Besides Eren, the Marleyan characters are products of sympathy now instead of hatred, which I thoroughly enjoy. Reiner, in particular, is focused on heavily at the first half of the season, and you can't help but feel bad for the guy. He turns into a very endearing character that matches Eren in complexity. The Warrior candidates that we are introduced to are all interesting, as well, especially Gabi and Falco, for completely different reasons. Gabi is hated EXTREMELY by a massive amount of fans due to some actions that she takes in this series. However, just realize beforehand that she serves as a parallel to Eren, as she is, essentially, a young Eren Jaegar on the Marleyan side. She's very memorable for the things that she does and says, for reasons that I can't say. Falco is our favorite residential empath, as he sees and sympthasizes with every side in AOT. Of course, that turns him into a punching bag, at times, but it's nice to have a truly wholesome character in this show. He serves as the perfect foil for Gabi throughout this season for that fact. In terms of other characters, we got new development all across the board, especially for Armin, Jean, Connie, Zeke, Hange, and Floch, who comes from a background character to a very important one. I really wish I could go into more detail, but y'all just need to see it for yourselves. It's, dare I say, peak fiction.

Enjoyment 10/10: I'm sure my praise for this show tells you all you need to know about how much I enjoy it. Attack on Titan is just one of those shows that will get you hooked and keep you like that long after its run time, and I honestly wouldn't have it any other way. It's just so entertaining to watch, as there's so many different reasons for someone to like this show. For me, I find so many reasons to keep watching.

Overall 10/10: AOT is a modern classic. I personally consider it a masterpiece, even if it has had a couple of small lows in it. It's just one of those few shows that defines a generation, as Attack on Titan is one of the first to come to mind when someone starts to talk about the new generation of anime (whether or not AOT is actually a new-get is up for debate, but you know what I mean). After all of this that has happened in the show, I am absolutely hyped to see how it all ends, albeit a little terrified.",2021-04-01T20:10:00+00:00,10
"this is not really a review, this is me rambling and there will probably be spoilers in here so be warned thanksi finished episode 16 a few days ago but my mind is still racing, i can't think, there are so many ideas and theories and predictions running through my head and i have no idea if any of them are even close to what will actually happen in part 2 but oh my goodness am i excited!!!!!!this show is really one of a kind. it's endlessly engaging and the action is fantastic and the characters are so distinct, and the direction the plot ismoving in is one i could have never ever predicted when i first started season 1

the plot???? it has become more intricate and darker than i could have expected. there were so many things that i just did not see coming and it increased my enjoyment so much because i essentially had to reset my brain to follow what was happening rather than what i thought would happen

the characters are such a big strength of the show as well, and so many characters were given such an opportunity to shine in this season, i loved it.

eren!!! who would have thought the angry little kid who had the most fierce determination and spirit would grow up into someone so grim and dark. i love it, i love this eren because it's such a stark contrast to how he used to be and yet it makes sense, with everything he has learned about titans and the world. his character development has been stellar

LEVI &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 my number one my favourite my main man i love him so so much, he's humanity's strongest in every way and he's just an incredible asset to the show. he's a quick thinker, he's incredibly strong physically but also emotionally, he can compartmentalise like nobody else and has a powerful sense of duty and taking action when necessary, but he also cares about everyone so much. HE BETTER BE OK

hange :( i miss the old hange who was overexcitable and wanted to learn everything they could about titans and the world. and now they are starting to realise that things are not as exciting as they once thought. like eren, hange is another character who has developed so much and changed a lot due to the situations that have arisen around them. it's a shame but it totally makes sense in the context of what is going on

sasha :( :( :(

i love the trio of jean/sasha/connie, they were hilarious and adorable and so close and made a really great team in all aspects. but seeing jean taking up more of a leadership role and seeing how everyone trusts and looks up to him is so satisfying, like a confirmation and continuation from earlier seasons but now even he accepts it as well which is so satisfying.

i like armin a lot more too (i liked him before!) - he was always realistic and pragmatic but it shines more now because he has more responsibility and respect, and honesly he has the best approach to so many of the situations that are arising. mikasa has improved a lot as well (i think because she is having less direct contact with eren so she is getting a chance to develop on her own oops) and her entrance scene vs the warhammer titan was one of my favourite moments of the season!!

there were also the characters from marley as well (gabi = annoying brat, falco = sweet kid who deserves better, pieck = clever and funny and warm, yelena = intriguing! hard to get a read on her sometimes, and yeah the others who i can't remember right now) but i'll admit that i'm far more attached to the paradis people and i was really fully engaged once they showed up again

i know a lot of people have some gripes with the animation and art style - and i admit it took me a few episodes to get used to it. but i like the fact that it's unique and different to WIT's style, and people would have complaints about it regardless so who cares what the negative comments say. the action sequences were animated so dynamically (the raid on liberio???? FANTASTIC. i watched those episodes SO MANY TIMES, they were heartstopping!! LEVI VS ZEKE). and there have also been so many visually stunning shots, with gorgeous detailing in the backdrops. i enjoyed it a lot, just as much as earlier seasons

my one and only ""complaint"" was with the non-linear storytelling. i totally accept that it adds another level of intrigue and layering and leaves it more up to us to figure out what happened when and where, which is great. but there did come a point where i was having to look up exactly what was happening when because i had a bit of trouble piecing it all together. maybe that was just me woops

(also in a couple of scenes the CGI did seem a bit too noticeable and out of place - like levi vs zeke in the forest, zeke looked very separate from the rest of the animation, if that makes sense, i don't know the right technical words. but i'm very willing to overlook it because i know how overworked the animators were and i would feel like a massive jerk for criticising them when i know they worked super hard on this)

(also also zeke's plan is NUTS, like what.)

anyway i can't wait until part 2 - i might just read the manga because my curiosity will probably get the better of me and i really really want to know how the story culminates :)))))

(i have a strong feeling that eren is going to do a lelouch, it makes sense to me because the storytelling has not been convincing enough to make me think eren has done a full 180 and changed character completely and has gone against everyone so strongly so suddenly. i'm convinced he's faking it and will do a big sacrifice a la lelouch. but let's see!)

as long as levi doesn't die &lt;3

"“The Road to Hell is paved with Good Intentions.” To live means to die. To be right, that means someone else must be wrong. To have peace means that first, there must be war.Story:Several years after the raid on Humanity within the Walls, we find ourselves within the country of Marley and watch how the supposed enemy fends off and conquers nearby lands in order to spread its influence. But, knowing the threat of Paradis Island, the home of Humanity within the Walls, is looming… Well, war is coming. Or rather, war is already here.For an adaptation that started in 2013 as a somewhat gratuitousgorefest with giant naked humans as the main antagonists, I don’t think I ever imagined the series to evolve into the state it is right now. In a span of sixteen episodes, the story of Attack on Titan manages to expand well beyond the confines of the three walls that the show previously had before, worldbuilding the series into a more interlinked universe that has seen its fair share of conflict and bloodshed. Thanks to some previous groundwork established in previous seasons, we get a much clearer version the ‘other side’ and how Marley operates and functions. Bearing some nods to Nazi Germany as a part of its framework while maintaining its own identity as a militarized nation that subjugates those not born of the same blood, as much of the Eldian race can attest to that idea. Not only that, but this several year timeskip from the previous season lends this season to showcase some changes to Humanity within the Walls as well, noting vital events and changes that’ve occurred since the first time Eren has stepped foot in the ocean. All of this to say nothing of the drastic shift in tone and story direction now that the truth of everything: the truth about the Titans, the truth about the Walls, and the truth about who the people within the walls are, is all out in the open for everyone in the cast to see.

Compared to the hopefulness that came from previous seasons, the ‘Final Season’ feels bleak and sometimes difficult to watch. The rawness of the series’ showing of war and conflict paints a grim picture to the reality of the cost of freedom or liberation. While the series never had much of an ‘us vs. them’ mentality to it, this truly feels like an instance where there really isn’t an answer to anything. To a point that the plot feels more like a showcasing of how brutal conflict can be, as well as the metric tons of blood it costs to get anywhere.

That’s not to say that the story is comprised of only death and the effects that death. True to the name, this season feels like the series is coming to a sort of ‘finality’ as the now immensely diverse and wide cast of character diverges off into different groups with oddly enough, similar goals of ‘peace’ at the end of the day. The narrative juggling them in a way that feels good to watch and while it might be mildly confusing at first given how many perspectives there are, works in the end due to the commonality that every faction in the series seems to have. That being said, one sticking point that I have in regards to this ‘season’ is its ending and how it ends in a place that makes it obvious that it would be incomplete at the start. My gripes with this comes with the fact that they kind of end the season just when things are starting to ‘get good’ so to speak, with what feels to be a ‘last confrontation’ happening just before the screen cuts to black. It’s really unfortunate and it makes it obvious that the decision to chop the thing in half was made for presumably corporate reasons, but thems the brakes I suppose. Not only that, but the show somehow feels a little rushed. I think this is partly because the series has a timeskip, and the changes from the characters from the end of Season 3 to now are told solely through backstory which in and of itself is a little muddled with what’s happening in the present time.

Regardless, density is only a minor issue since the storytelling is competent enough to handle that level of depth and content. And all of the death and carnage is surprisingly enough to carry the story all on its own by showing what’s happening instead of just laying it on thick with monologue or reports. Which is something I can definitely get behind because with how much is shown as ‘setup’ vs. how much is told to help get the ball rolling, I can definitely get behind the former over the latter.

Characters:

It’s at this time where I also think that characters have begun to lose their individuality in a way and kind of get swept into the greater narrative. Much of what remains of the characters we knew of before are (understandably) shells of their former selves who have PTSD or have something missing in them as a result of so many years of fighting. Mantras and personal missions or goals effectively fill in the spots that these characters used to take up, metamorphosing the cast into a vast array of individuals who are barely holding on or seek something new as a way to be noble or serve the ‘greater good’. With a few notable exceptions like Levi, much of the original cast are hardly like their younger selves, and it feels harrowing to see what used to be a bunch of reckless teenagers grow up to be the kind of people they’ve had to become.

Much can be said about the many new additions to the cast, though to a much less notable degree. I’d like to say that the ‘effects of war’ are essentially the reason why these characters come out the way they do. New inclusions like Falco and Gabi not only have story relevance but also show the effects of racial divide and the supposed need for liberation. While much of the other groups that have stake in the future of the world manage to also show the audience both the best and worst of humanity, as well as the mantra that “The road to Evil is paved with Good Intentions”.

Which brings us to Eren, our once hot-blooded shonen protagonist who wanted to kill all of the titans. While his character changes are drastic to put it mildly, the shift in his character encapsulates so much of what has happened up until this point, and while at first I was confused at the direction, as time went on, I kind of understood why Isayama went this direction with Eren. And considering that in addition to everything else that we’ve seen up until this point, who Eren is now serves as a fantastic focal point for the series to beam down on as it’s clear that everything from all sides has clearly affected him in a way that feels impossible to return from. There’s a weight, a heaviness to his character that evokes a sense of hopelessness to everything that’s happened up until this point, contributing to the overall tone of the show that permeates every minute of the season. Which for character depth and development is a hell of a way to change things around. And I’m all for it even if him and a lot of the cast feel a lot more like loons than people I’d trust to hold a rifle.

Aesthetics:

The change from Wit Studio to MAPPA certainly is a big blow for the series, and it honestly kind of shows. The overall artstyle of the show hasn’t changed as much as I though it would, but there are some notable differences. The biggest of which being the CG titans, which previously were all hand-drawn and if they were CG, they were a lot less obvious with it. On top of that, the art quality itself has gone down a bit, but aside from that, there really isn’t much to say in terms of the aesthetic changes.

For me personally, I’m glad they kept the shading lines that Isayama uses and it’s frequent in all of the characters, especially in the close-up shots. I’ve always felt like it was one of Isayama’s hallmarks with the way he draws the series, and not having that would’ve felt wrong. So I’m glad they kept it. More than that, me thinking that Season 3 was going to be bloody was really giving this season not enough credit. To be fair, Season 3 did have a giant pile of corpses that Erwin was sitting on, but here we have chopped up bodies, squishing people like packets of ketchup, the whole nine yard with people being eaten, and beating up children or other people (but mostly children) till they’re battered and mutilated. There’s absolutely no subtlety with the body count in this series now, and every death, mangling, and bit of carnage this show has is showcased full force in the center of the frame with only mild censorship on a case by case basis. As I said, this show is raw. As in raw meat is spilled in every corner of the screen.

While most AoT OPs have sat somewhere on the ‘patriotic’ side of the spectrum by sounding like patriotic songs taht you would sing as you were heading out into the battlefield, “Boku no Sensou” by Shinsei Kamattechan is in a way the inverse of that. While it bears some very, very vague bars that sound similar to previous OPs that is where the similarities end. This song sounds twisted, dark, almost insidious in a way with how the normally patriotic bars of the previous opening are given these different meanings. Almost as if the patriotic songs give recruits the false sense of security that they’re going to war to fight for their country when in reality they’re just more blood for the slaughter as they face the reality of war. It’s a great OP, but works even more fantastically because of the show that it’s tied to.

When you compare it to Yuko Ando’s “Shock“, we get a very somber song. Like the dust in the battlefield settled and there’re only peaceful dead bodies as everyone who was a part of the fighting is free from the pain of war. It’s again a deep departure from the rest of the EDs we’ve gotten before, although this one is still on a somewhat similar vein to those other songs due to most AoT EDs sounding a lot quieter by comparison.

Personal Enjoyment:

Another year of waiting for the actual, actual finale of the series, eh? I mean if you’re calling the finale ‘part 2’ of the ‘Final Season’, is this one really the ‘Final Season’? I’m gonna keep nitpicking this because this trend is honestly really annoying and I don’t want to fall into the idea of “Season X is only like half of Season X. The other half will come later” being commonplace since the cut-offs are usually at either really awkward moments, or JUST as things are happening. Yeah good hook and all for next time, but it’s not a good look if you keep baiting the audience like this. Just give the staff enough time to make it all in one shot, will ya?

All of that aside, I’m again, really at a loss for words for a show that just kind of blew any and all expectations I had for it. Never did I think that Attack on Titan was going to ever elevate itself to this point, and I concede to Hajime Isayama for creating something that truly questions the worth of life and the worth of living. From what started off as a simple series about wanting freedom from captivity turned into a grander question of asking what it truly means to be ‘free’ and even more so what the cost of that freedom is. Every bit of the narrative has some kind of handle over the whole thing, the questions of which the show tackles being asked to both the characters and to the audience. By this point, I cannot tell you who is right and who is wrong. Beyond what’s presented, there’re so many additional layers that could be theorized to be built upon what’s been presented, smaller stopgates that hinder the march of progress towards freedom, all of which necessitate a toll of blood to be paid in order for those gates to be lifted.

And that’s what I love about this story. There is no right answer to the problem; only ones that others will see as wrong. And the only guarantees in battles like these are that friends and family in one way or another will be lost along the way. Weirdly enough, I’ve never felt this helpless watching a show before. I was so immersed in the narrative and the story that I was oddly enough at a loss for words at what could be done. Which is why I don’t really have that many quips for this show and why I’m anticipating the end of the series so much.

I do have a few other nitpicky details here and there regarding certain parts of the show, but there’s not a lot else that can be said without risking spoiler details. But I will say this: this series will most likely end up being one of the greats. And that’s not just because this show is unilaterally regarded as one of the best products of the medium. This show really does not pull any punches with what it wants to showcase, and does it at such a pace that feels even without only a few minor bumps in the road. More than that, it makes the audience think. Is it worth saving one life if it costs dozens? Is freedom worth it if we have to suffer to get it? Or is it better to survive but live in fear with your head down for the rest of your life? Is your life more valuable than another’s? Because no matter what you say as an answer, someone else out there will disagree.",2021-03-31T19:04:00+00:00,9
"I think that my opinion about AoT is quite different from what people use to say about it, so this is my personal point of view.But let's go step-by-step.STORY: 8I always said that story is of course the strenght of this anime, because it has a very original plot, that looks different from all the current shōnen.BUT I never liked how this story was telled: idk if it is due to the fact that I watched the first season in 2015, so I perceived all the anime ""flow"" in a very slow way, but I felt like if all the seasons were in fact veryvery slow, with a huge amount of dialogues, random plot twists that are not real plot twists (some examples - POSSIBLE SPOILERS ABOUT PREVIOUS SEASONS: we all knew that Annie was a titan, and also Reiner was predictable, or that titans were humans after the first season, while ""the smartest"" Hange did absurde suppositions like «maybe titans can dig under the ground, so for this reason we found them inside the walls»... uhm, okay...), random flashbacks about random characters in random moments (but I'll talk about them in the next paragraph), things revealed in a certain moment, but not totally, so the effect is that all seems to be non-linear, irregular.

But let's go beyond the past.
I have to admit that this season was a bit different: finally, I found interesting almost all the episodes! In every episode happens something important/totally unespected, so I finally didn't perceive that ""slowness""/""irregularity"", despite the presence of that type of dialogues. There are more than one plot twists that are real plot twists! It's like AoT became another anime, compared to other seasons, with a totally different perspective, and that's great. 

CHARACTERS: 7
Also in this case I found an improvement.

I really can't understand people who say that Eren became a worse character: Eren was totally an unidimensional character, I didn't like him at all, he was only a child screaming ""I want to kill all titans!!!"". Very ridicolous. Fortunately, this character had a development, the course of events drived him crazy, but it's totally ok, totally normal, the contrary would be strange! And who cares if now he is an as***le, at least finally, after four seasons, he became an adult, more mature, indipendent and realistic.

Other characters I appreciated in this season are: Reiner, Zeke, Sasha. We finally know something more about them.
*SPOILER: to be honest, we had to wait for some deaths to know something about the past/the family of some of these characters, but ok...*.

Mikasa is useless as always. Maybe the author himself noticed that she was a fu**ing anonymous character and tried to justify it, in some way... But for me, she's still a bad character, with no personality at all.

Gabi and Falco are well made too, in my opinion. They had a lot of space in this season, and that's fine.

Sometimes I think that in this anime there are too many characters, but the majority of them is literally just an appearance, or maybe only one season focuses on them a bit more, but after that they don't matter anymore (for example: Historia. One season was mainly about her and Ymir, but then???).

In this case, I really liked Armin in the previous seasons, but in this one...? Maybe fans went crazy just because he became adult and cool, wow, but nothing else.

Same for Levi, of course he is cool every season, he is strong, he is a fighter, ok... but that's all. He is one of the most popular character of AoT, but what do we really know about him?

And I really don't understand why is Hange so appreciate... She's not smart, neither funny or pleasant to me.
But that's my personal opinion.

In general, I still feel very detached from the most of the characters, but at least I found an improvement, especially about the main character.

ANIMATION: 8
MAPPA studio did a good job. If you think that this was a bad cgi, you really have never seen a BAD cgi. This one didn't annoy me at all. Animation in AoT anime did exaclty what drawings in manga are not able to do. And for me, it isn't worse than Wit studio's animation.

SOUNDS: 7
At the beginning, I was really disappointed about the opening: the previous ones were literally epic, but this? It doesn't communicate to me a lot. After some listenings, I admit it's not that terribile... it often resounds in my head, it's quite catchy. But the scenes in the opening are so... empty. A sequence of explosions? Wtf? 
So, niiice, but I prefer the previous ones.
Soundtrack is ok. I mean, maybe it's not that memorable in my opinion, but surely it works.

OVERALL: 8
AoT is definitely a good anime, and this season satisfyed me more than the others. Because of this improvement, my score is about 8 (other seasons were 6.5/7).
I can't really consider it a masterpiece, and I still remain ""distant"" from the most of the characters and from the anime itself. Maybe it is just not exactly my genre, or maybe this perception is also due to the amount of fans who overspam this anime (but mostly only to share spoilers or to fangirl about male characters such as Levi, or Reiner, or adult Eren/Armin, not for valid reasons), or the general ""overrating"" (I heard some people comparing AoT manga with Berserk and??? what about no???), that make AoT quite annoying, so actually I'm no more in hype that much, and that's pretty sad.",2021-03-31T10:35:00+00:00,8
"I am shocked by the 'controversy' that this season has sparked. Hard-core fans can be quite extreme. I didn't realize this until now. I deleted my previous review because I've now watched the whole series, so updated and edited it here. Story: 10/10. I would have given SnK a 11/10 if I could. It is a masterpiece. SnK made me re-evaluate all of my ratings for other animes so far because this series blew them all out of the water, and I have seen Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Madoka and Hunter x Hunter, etc. The story has evolved so much that it has almost become unrecognizable(in a good way). While the first season revolves around the mystery of man-eating Titans and shape-shifting Titans, this season shines the light on humanity, power, war, and freedom. It is a visceral portrayal of socio-institutional subjugation and revolt. It is a reality-based work where everything is perpetually gray, with no one right or wrong in a fight for freedom. As Bertolt, one of the antagonists, said in season 3, ""You are not evil. And you have done nothing wrong. But you all must die."" The contingency of history has compelled all of our characters, who had no role in shaping that history, to choose a side, even if their morals torment, claw and scream at them. AoT is one of the rare series that does not need to rely on beautiful animated fighting sequences (which it definitely does not lack, however) to keep you engaged, but rather on emotional, heart-wrenching acts, as exemplified by S4E5's conversation between Reiner and Eren. Shame on the haters for saying AoT relying on shock factors (which might have been true for season 1) to entice viewers, because if you just take a look at any of the highest-rated episodes of this modern masterpiece, you can see that none of them has any shock factors, but purely superb narrative power.

Art: 9/10. Here comes the controversy. The art is inconsistent, but most of the time, it is gorgeous. You can see a dip in quality in the middle episodes when things were slowing down, like in ep 11 (if my memory serves me right), but it is an exposition episode. Most of the time, the characters are just standing around talking, so I don't understand why some people were so offended by the ""mediocre"" animation and art. If you are into the storyline, the small dip in art quality in less important episodes doesn't bother you at all. But I guess hardcore fans want everything to be perfect, including skinny Levi, so there's that. The CGI isn't half-bad. The only jarring CGI I notice is in ep 6, with a couple of videogamish shots. They totally make up for it in ep 7. But again, CGI is an abomination in many fans' eyes, no matter how well-done it is. There are scenes that are not even CGI and yet some fans still consider them such, so I don't even know how legit some of the complaints are. I think for more casual anime fans, they don't care, but many of the people who follow AOT week by week are hardcore (mangareaders) fans, so they want everything to be perfect. I am in it mostly for the story, so the inconsistency doesn't bother me one bit. Watch it and decide for yourself. 

Character: 10/10. Please pay no attention to air-headed haters who give a 1/10 to the characters because they clearly have not watched season 3p2 or 4. If the characters of this show are flat and one-dimensional, there are no characters in any show that are deep and complex. I cannot believe they have the audacity to give characters a low score when a whole Reiner exists. The previous seasons already give glimpses into Reiner's past, his struggle with living the double-life, and his trauma of causing Eren's mother's death, but this season go into details about his motivations and guilt. We get to see the traitor trio's past and their reasons for destroying humanity inside the walls, and not only do we understand them, but also wholly sympathize with them. Meanwhile, Eren's incredible emotional maturity also comes as a shock to viewers, for we can no longer see the screaming and spontaneous 15-year-old boy whom we are used to in the previous seasons. Instead, we are introduced to a calm, collected, and even cold-blooded Eren Yaeger who is determined to take back his freedom, at whatever costs. 

Besides these two most well-written characters imo, the other casts are very well-fleshed, too, such as Armin, Levi, Erwin, Jean, Historia, and the antagonists. Some other supporting characters are not as well-developed, but to be fair, I have never seen any show that can give spotlight to every single character. 

Sound:10/10. Sawano composed the music, and the new MAPPA composer, Yamamoto, is superb as well. AoT has long been famous for its soundtrack, so I don't think I need to comment much further.
I was appalled when someone criticized the soundtrack in ep 5 because it wasn't what they wanted. I swear, non-AoT hardcore fans will come in watching this masterpiece and have no idea what the online cesspool was screaming about the music when it was airing. 

Enjoyment: 10/10. 11/10 if I could. Personally, I think some fans are being very unfair, not crediting the studio for what they did right while focusing too much on what they did wrong. The storyboarding, characterization, directing, and editing are all great, but somehow several CGI shots ruined the adaptation. I think this is because manga readers already know what happens in the story and thus put most of their enjoyment into art and action, which makes them vulnerable if the art and action don't reach their *high* expectation. Not trying to invalidate their feelings, but I think they should evaluate an anime adaptation more objectively (I mean, what is the rubric for?)

Anyway, I have never been so invested in an anime before. Every episode leaves me thinking for days and wanting more. It is haunting, thought-provoking, epic, and just simply breathtaking. If you have not yet caught up, do yourself a favor and catch up with AoT because you are missing out on the greatest anime of the decade, and possibly of all time.",2021-03-30T20:52:00+00:00,10

"Despite the change in the studio, which is the most controversial topic regarding Attack on Titan Final Season, its story is the only thing that saw an improvement as always. Mappa tried their best to give the show the same glory that Wit Studio provided but for whatever reasons it wasn't the same. While the character's design is closer to Manga, the CG is what ruined the battle sequence. I like the new character design as they are more good to match the theme of the show.The music is somewhat good but it lacks the amazing work of Sawano which I am sure most ofyou agree with. Ashes of Fire is the only OST that I found good. 
The biggest thing that bothered me is the direction. The final season lacks the amazing direction of Tetsuro Araki that was one of the reasons for the success of the show. 
But the story is what balances out these things and still makes it the best show ever to watch. 
But if they were to work on this project I am sure we would see a lot more improvement in the show. 
I am glad that Mappa picked it but despite their hard work, there is always something they will lack. 
Mappa somewhat balances out the WIT work but the lack of Tetsuro Araki and Hiroki Sawano won't balance out. 
IT is not that the new ones are bad, it just that they are far superior.",2021-03-30T11:17:00+00:00,10
"With a second pat for the final season coming next year, all I can say is... damn. Every character has received brilliant levels of development, all of the new characters introduced this season has an important purpose and are all overall great characters. Even characters aside, the story itself has evolved past everything that I had ever expected and has truly turned into something special. Add the two together, and you've already gotten a modern masterpiece.Now to address the elephant in the room. The animation. The first thing that I'd like to say is that it's good. Not absolutely stunning Wit levels of animation. Notthe God awful travesty that was Berserk 2016-2017. Just good. Given the time that the poor animators at Mappa had, I'm honestly impressed at the constant quality of the episodes that they've been outputting, sporting some very impressive CGI and equally impressive 2d animation. Of course, it gets rough in certain places, but it isn't Berserk 2016, which in my book, is an automatic plus. To sum it up, is it as good as Wit? No. But the animation still services the story, and honestly, that's all I could ever ask for.",2021-03-30T09:10:00+00:00,10
"AND STILL....HEAVYWEIGHT ANIME CHAMPION OF THE WORRRRLLLLLDDDDDD...HUNTER X HUNTER (2011)!!!Imagine that you go to a new pizza joint that is all the rave.  You order your favorite style of pizza and they serve it to you. It's piping hot, fresh ingredients, buttery flaky crust, it's one of the best pizzas you've ever had. And then just as you lift the last piece up, a fat roach that was crawling under the crust scurries out from under it and jumps into your lap, into your pants, and crawls around on your legs.  You shake it out and step on it.  You're appalled, disgusted,the thing has been crawling on you, all on your food. You demand to speak to the manager and the Manager says: ""Sorry about that. I tell you what: We'll give you a coupon to get a free pizza. But, you can only redeem it after Winter of 2022."".  

That's Attack on Titan. 

It was so close, closer than any anime has been in years to beating Hunter X Hunter as my favorite anime of all time. (A Pizza that was never finished...*sigh*), but at the very last minute, they not only totally screwed the pooch, but they also have the nerve to make you wait almost a year to finish watching them screw it.  A season that appeared to be a fantastic final arc of revenge for the citizens of Paradis that we have watched suffer relentless torture for years; suddenly spirals into a quagmire of flawed logic, senseless motivations, and just confusing decisions that make little to no sense whatsoever.  Instead of the bloody, brutal, and oh, so fulfilling comeuppance for the nation of Marley you expect (and the anime teases after the first few episodes), you're left at the end scratching your head as to ""why?"". Or, you would be if you weren't so astonished at the balls of them to actually make you wait nearly ANOTHER YEAR for a conclusion. 

Note to Attack on Titan creators: When you say ""Final Season"", FINISH THE DAMN SEASON. Then you can do your cash grab ""After the Final Season Movie."" This was nothing but a calculated decision to keep the AoT on the minds of fans for another year, so they can sell stuff before wrapping up the show and seeing their fanbase move on to other things.  It's a trash tactic. 

But this show will NOT be on my mind, because the ending is so dumb, so bereft of any logic, I have no desire to wait a year to see it play out.  And that's really sad to say seeing how much I loved this anime over the years.  But, I'm not going to reward stupidity and greed.  

HERE COME THE SPOILERS: 

So, what makes Attack on Titan: Final Season so stupid?  AoT has spent years building up great characters forged by the pure hell that Marley unleashed on them, without them ever knowing why it was happening to them.  When Season 3 revealed what the reason was, and what was truly going on, it was one of the most stunning swerves in Anime History.  So, when the Final Season comes around, you figure that everything is going to come to a satisfying conclusion from the moment Eren reveals himself to Reiner in the Liberio Internment Zone.  

And man, what an enthralling, captivating, and amazing battle that was.  Almost as good as Perfect Game in season 3. When the Scout Regime busts in to back up Eren, and you watch them just wreck Marley, it was fantastic to watch.  You didn't know how they planned to bring Marley down exactly, seeing how they were a superpower, and Paradis is just a small island, but you figured they'd have some kind of masterplan.  After all, it appeared as though Eren and the Scouts had been infiltrating and setting up this attack for years.  

But, when a much more sullen and ""broken"" Eren finally returns to the airship, you could already tell something was amiss. The tearful Mikasa, Armin hesitant to reach out to take Eren's hand, something was wrong. And then when Levi kicked him in the face, you realize this wasn't a part of some masterplan from the Paradis brass to eliminate the enemy that nearly drove them to extinction.  It's revealed that Eren has actually gone rouge, joined up with his brother Zeke of all people, and purposely drew Paradis into attacking Marley by making them come and rescue him because he's the Founding Titan and they can't let him die or fall into the hands of Marley.

Okay, okay...I can get with this.  My thought was ""Clearly, Eren and Zeke have hatched a plan where Eren will eat all of the Titans that Marley has, get taken back to Paradis, then when the world attacks Paradis because Eren killed all their dignitaries, Zeke and Armin (Who is secretly in on the plan, so I thought), would feed Annie to Eren, then sacrifice themselves, allow themselves to be eaten by Eren, and then Eren would become the reincarnation of Ymir or something, and destroy the militaries of the world with his power, ending the threat to all Eldians. Then in some noble sacrifice, do something with his power to eliminate all Titans everywhere (keeping his mission to destroy all Titans from the first season) and then sacrifice himself. Thus destroying the nation that tortured them, saving Eldians from becoming Titans, and dying with a noble sacrifice as a tearful Mikasa cries over his and Armin's grave.  The End. Sure, things didn't go according to plan in Marley and they only got one, but during the war, Eren will get the Cart and the Jaw, with the help of the Beast and Colossal titan, and then they'll finish their noble plan.""

WRONG. 

Instead, Erin sits in his cell for most of the season back in Paradis while everyone tries to figure out why he sided with Zeke, pretty much their greatest enemy. Eren just broods there while the anime focuses more on the Marleyans inside of Paradis. The mysterious and fanatical Yelena, the super irritating Gabi (A brainwashed warrior candidate, who I want to die so badly because of who she killed.) her sidekick Falco, Niccolo (A captured chef), and Zeke. What should have been the war to end all ages, was instead replaced with political intrigue, flashbacks and stories of morality, and choosing peace over bloodshed.  

Because Eren stayed locked up by the military so long, a revolution forms around him as a savior type figure, with Eldians seeing him as the savior that dealt a huge blow to their oppressors.  Only thing is, this was all a part of the plan. Eren was plotting the revolution with Floch, Zeke, and Yelena.  Eren helped to mastermind an assassination and coup plot that not only killed Zachary but nearly killed Mikasa and Armin in the process and killed several scout recruits.  Not ONLY this, but the man was actually plotting with Zeke, Floch, and Yelena to poison the military and police with wine tainted with Zeke's spinal fluid. The poison makes it so that if he yells, it turns them into titans that Zeke can control.  Something Zeke used to kill ALL of Levi's men.  All of them.  Eren was actually down with Zeke poisoning the entire leadership of his country that he fought at all costs to protect for years and turning them into the very titans he despised. Historia could've drunk the wine. Pixis DID drink it. Hange, Levi, anyone. Hell, Jean and Connie almost drank it. Eren was suddenly down with the transformation and death of anyone he knew, even close allies.   

So, surely, there has to be some kind of heroic motivation that Eren has for all of this.  And it has to be a pretty good one, because not only is he killing Eldians, threating to turn people into titans and throwing the whole country into turmoil after making them a target for extermination by all nations of the world, he also beats the living hell out of Armin, and tells Mikasa he's hated her since she was a child, because she's a slave to Ackerman blood and only protects him because of the memories of previous generations of Ackermanns.  

Clearly, he's being so villainous because he knows that the will and memories of the founder and previous titans are controlling their fates, so he wants to free them from it.  Or, he has to separate himself from his friends so they don't get caught up in his coup to destroy the nations of the world using Paradis as a staging ground. They have to live on free after he's dead and not be punished, right? It has to be something REALLY noble. Like, Lelouch Lamperouge's ""Zero Requiem"" noble.  

What could be this noble plan for which the heroic Eren, who has been willing to sacrifice everything to free his people from the threat of the Titans and now the threat from Marley and the nations of the world, has thrown away all his friends and the respect they had for him? What magnificent plan has he fomented that is worth him being willing to watch any ally die and laugh at their deaths?

GENOCIDE.

But, not genocide targeting the Marleyans. No.

He intends to commit genocide via mass-sterilization against the ELDIANS. His own people.    

Because somehow, Eren Yeager, the dude you've watched for years fight to save his people from the brink of extinction time and again, has come to the conclusion that the only way to save his people is to prevent them from having children.  If there are no Eldians born, then no Eldians have to suffer. The man who fought for years to prevent the extinction of his people has suddenly decided the best way to save them is...extinction.  Logic +100.   

That's the masterplan that Zeke and Eren have cooked up. Zeke, who they led you to believe was a loyal Marleyan puppet from a child, actually found out that if the Founding Titan touches a Titan with Royal Blood, then the Founding Titan (Eren) can alter the DNA of all Eldians.  He decides that the best way to save Eldians is to prevent them from having babies.  But, he can't make that decision, that decision has to fall to the Founder.  And so, with amazing ease, Zeke convinces Eren this is the best way to go about saving Eldians and the people of Paradis.  

And so that's why Eren has gone full-on villain.  Because killing off your own people is the best way to save them from their oppressors.  And that's just science, man. 9 out of 10 doctors agree.  

If you've been watching AoT for any amount of time, I don't even have to point out to you the reasons why this is senseless.  If you've followed the Eren Yeager character this long, you already know this is dumb beyond belief.  This whole premise is just stupid.  Why do you even have to make it so complicated? Just have them kill Marleyans until they die, have a great ending, and go down as the best anime ever made.  Why did you have to screw it all up with this stupid ""We have to end the cycle of violence"" theme that makes NO SENSE?  

And that theme is all throughout the anime.  The Eldians repeat over and over how sick they are of all the mindless deaths.  They act as though they've been killing Marleyans as often as Marleyans have been killing them.  Marley was orchestrating their deaths for generations and Paradis only just found out they even existed four years ago.  They've never done anything to them.  Even if they wholeheartedly accepted the myth that Eldians suppressed the world centuries ago, it's illogical that people who have nothing to do with that would want to seek peace with their oppressors.  As though they've been slaughtering them in warfare the past four years or something. Their only encounters with Marley since they knew they existed was to take the sailors they sent hostage. They didn't even kill them. It makes no sense.  Why wouldn't Jean tell his men to throw an enemy out of the air balloon after what Gabi did? What does he mean by ""Will the cycle ever end?"" What cycle? You never attacked Marley before that moment.  What does a certain father mean by ""My little girl invaded another country and got shot?"", she went to rescue one of her own and died in the process. She was fighting the people who filled your orphanage with orphaned kids whose parents died brutal deaths.  What the hell are you talking about? 

This illogical mindset is amplified in Eren and Zeke to the point of sheer ludicrousness. End the suffering of your people by ending your people? It's so dumb and half-baked they couldn't even bother to name the plot correctly. They kept calling it ""Euthanasia Plan"".  Euthanasia is the assisted suicide of a person seeking to die. What you are doing is genocide via mass-sterilization. At least name the end-game plot of your anime correctly. Geez...  To draw a comparison, they kept using imagery that compared the Eldians to the Ashkenazi Jews and Marley to Nazi Germany.  Imagine if the Ashkenazi's said: ""Hey, the best way to stop the suffering of this holocaust is to make ourselves go extinct."".  How dumb is that?  

There's a second half to all of this coming all the way in winter of 2022. (I thought it was only going to be a final episode.) But, unless they do some equally ridiculous turnaround of everything they've built up in this half, I can't see how they can salvage this nonsense. I can't even wrap my mind around how such a fantastic anime, an anime that has been one of the best ever for a long time, could end in such a ridiculous and infuriating fashion.  

Literally, all you had to do was have one war.  All you had to do was the same thing you've been doing since 2013: Have a series of mind-blowing fights. That's it. Have the Eldians rise up and kill the Marleyans and free themselves.  Or, even a dark ending where they fail and die, opening up the possibility for a sequel down the road where Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Levi, etc...are martyrs and a new generation must rise up to follow in their footsteps. You didn't have to complicate things with needless coups, senseless character changes (seriously, what the hell was up with Floch?), ridiculous lessons in morality and peace, or convoluted alliances that switched at a moment's notice.  All you had to do was keep it simple.  As simple as putting down roach traps in your pizzeria.",2021-03-30T02:10:00+00:00,1
"Attack on Titan has taken a drastic shift since the last season. With a four-year timeskip since the Colossal Titan was newly inherited, you can expect that a lot of the characters will be drastically different—not only in appearance, but also sometimes in character.Story: Attack on Titan never fails to deliver a richly complex, layered story. Now, we start in Marley with a World War I vibe, from the perspective of Marley warrior candidates. 10/10Art: Detailed expressions, especially for horror and fear. Most of the fight scenes are brilliantly executed. Occasionally, the ODM gear movement feels a little too smooth, without as much of thewhiplash-feeling movement as in previous seasons. 9/10

Sound: Fantastic. It builds suspense and adds to high-tension situations. 9/10

Character: Eren Jaeger is not your typical protagonist. In the first three seasons, his goal has been to annihilate titans; now, he recognizes — as Erwin hinted at long ago — who the real enemy is. With so many sides of the war, Eren's motivation is a bit obscured. Gabi Braun is Reiner's younger cousin and the Marley version of Eren. Her obsessive revenge makes her one-dimensional most of the time (much like Eren in the early seasons). Reiner Braun is the most intriguing character, especially in the first few episodes of the season. After his experience on Paradis, he no longer shares the views of most honorary Marleyans; his views are more nuanced now. With him and Eren older and more psychologically developed, the final showdown between them will be thrilling. 10/10

Enjoyment: With so many layers in the story, I want to know more—what is the best solution for Paradis? Does Zeke really have Paradis's best interests at heart? Which side does Eren truly align with? What will happen between Marley and Paradis? 10/10

Opening: So different from the previous openings, but phenomenal in its own way. Perfect for the horror-filled atmosphere.

Ending: Beautiful. Falco doesn't seem like a relevant character after the first few episodes, though.

Overall: I recommend this anime if you watched the first three seasons of Attack on Titan. It continues to build on the world introduced and developed earlier, by showing us the bigger picture ^^ 9/10",2021-03-29T10:37:00+00:00,9
"well well.. I see alot of reviewbombers, bait reviews and middle-aged men aka FMAB bots spamming useless reviews, so here's a honest review AOT Final Season has seen hype that reached levels never seen before in an anime. As a result someone may fall into the trap of  ""overhyped anime"" but trust me when I say this.. AOT is one of the very few anime that DESERVES the hype!!Story: 10/10anyone who has watched the last 3 seasons should know that AOT is story focused and this season especially.. it was masterfully crafted. The plot points, plot twists, plot reveals.. it just doesnt get anybetter than this. Its a story that will always keep you in the edge of your seat

Note: since AOT is so focused on Story-telling, I would advise people to head into the season knowing all about what happened in s3

Animation: 9/10
Now we're getting into the juicy stuff... so much said about CGI, 3D titans, blah blah blah.. but its mostly just someone who already has ""CGI bad"" engraved inside their head. The CGI this season has honestly been one of the best use of CGI in anime.. Its GOOD CGI (ofc not Land of Lustrous or Beastars level)
although, a few shots of titans looked weird and its to be expected right? but most CGI titans looked great!! anyway.. moving away from CGI, the animation was amazing!! AOT doesnt need some flashy animation like JJK or KNY, it needs a good one and this season did a great job following up S3

Art: 10/10
OMG! The background art in this season has been the best in AOT!!
 Its so so beautiful and mesmerizing
apart from that, the character designs are very close to the Manga (as it should)
Reiner, Armin, Eren.. they all look good
There a few frames with lanky character design (as in all other seasons) which will be fixed 

Characters: 10/10
A good story needs good characters.. and Isayama has developed this amazing cast of characters with their own flaws and multi-dimensional personalities. A bunch of new characters are introduced and they make the story even MORE INTERESTING!

Sound: 9/10
Look.. I'm no music connoisseur, so Idk what to say about that. This season has a completely different theme than the last 3 seasons and so it needed a new OST and goddamn they pulled off some amazing soundtracks filled with hype!
also, the OP and ED for this season can literally be someone's favorite in AOT

Enjoyment: 10/10
as you can probably guess.. I love an interesting plot and honestly, AOT is probably a modern masterpiece already. say whatever you want.. no one can take away the writing of Isayama sensei
I enjoyed it a alot and Im sure its the same with many.

 I cant take someone seriously when they say
 ""It was so overhyped that it ruined my experience""  lol
You just fell into the elitist mindset trap


Overall: 10/10 
Adaptation wise: 9/10


basically me saying AOT is great..
and you should watch it cauz its great..
did I mention it was great?


I love both FMAB and AOT, so can both sides please stop review-bombing?
not that MAL ratings matter anyway

for anime-onlys, please try to stay clear of spoilers and lets wait patiently for Winter 2022. Bye",2021-03-29T03:36:00+00:00,10
"*Spoiler Review*Since the end of season 3 I have become a huge fan of Snk I think about it every day it has become a real obsession so when the announcement of season 4 I was very hyped even if there was a change of studio I had confidence I said to myself that no one could destroy a work so dear to my heart then the trailer was released and the chara design with it. I was obviously very surprised at the beginning because it was absolutely not the same as with Wit Studio but it seemed really good and when the first episodearrived we learned that the studio had not a lot of time to do this season (around 6-7 months) and that Mappa had taken charge of the project because no other studio wanted to take over snk because of the workload and the time to release the sequel. So I was a little scared to be honest but I will try to give you my opinion and tell you why this season is a success but that Mappa's situation is representative of the Japanese animation industry.

Story 10/10 : 

Unsurprisingly with season 4 we learn a lot more about Mahr and the motivation of the different characters. we follow the point of view of Gaby and her aspiring friends etc ... (I will not tell the story in detail) So the more the episodes advance the more the story develops and we go from surprise to surprise it's just amazing especially if you haven't read the manga you can't predict future events and when you think you're on the right track you end up completely lost it's still a stroke of genius on the part of Isayama. Elements and moments of the story that are in season 1 are now explained and everything becomes logical, notably the story of the Ackermans or Sieg Jäger the motivations of each character. To conclude at the end of this first part you find yourself with too many questions which will be explained later and between each episodes you form new theories which are for the most part destroyed the episodes after it's just a pleasure to share theories with people every Sunday evening. in short, to conclude it is really one of the rare stories to build so well in the world of manga and I am weighing my words.

Sound 10/10 : 

Once again as for all the other seasons the opening music was incredible even if at the first listening the opening seems strange but in the end for me it is probably one of the best opening of snk it's just incredible the lyrics make lot of semse  so a big congratulations to Shinsei Kamattechan the ending remains more classic but still very nice. For the ost we have the arrival of Kohta Yamamoto who works on the ost of Mahr such as Ashes on The Fire and Hiroyuki Sawano always so incredible that said a small problem of music during episode 5 and the transformation of Eren at the end from Willy Tybur's speech in a personal capacity it is the first time that I was disappointed with the use of a music in such an important moment of snk otherwise on the whole it always remains at the top notament during the battle of Revelio.


Character 10/10 :

Do I really need to talk about the characters in snk? All the characters without exception are amazing I have rarely seen so many good characters in an anime. I'll give you an example Sieg Jäger that I previously hate because he was partly responsible for the death of my favorite character (Erwin) yet as this season I learned and understood his motivation and in the end even if I still have a grudge I have a little more compassion for him. Another example the death of Sasha Braus was horrible for me I really felt enormous pain and sadness for a week I cried a lot all because of the death of one of my favorite characters it's literally the last character to bring some humor to the dark world of snk and now it's over. I could very well talk about Reiner who has a very interesting behavior or Gaby who is a representation of Eren petit on the side of Mahr or even of Floch who has a superb evolution compared to season 3 but I would say that the most incredible c ' is Eren's transformation he has become impacable he has a goal and will do anything to achieve it he has no limits and the tear with Armin and Mikasa is just dramatic short it's just amazing but at the same time so hard to see .


Studio ?/10 :

Well this is the hardest moment of the criticism Mappa did a very good job must be recognized yes there are a lot of CGIs and I don't like it compared to the titan of the seasons before (except the colosal) but overall to say that Mappa made snk bad is to say crap. Making such a qualitative adaptation in such a short time is really an exploit so bravo to the host that said I'm sorry but because of the very very dubious choice on the part of the Mappa committee who just wanted to outdo the hype at the end of the manga we had the right to this quick release. I explain if the studio had had all the time they should have had to be able to do the animation of snk we would not have had this CGI outrageously and still shots I repeat the animation remains good in the whole thing but I'm just disappointed that Mappa didn't have the time and that the animators had to work so long to end up being often insulted on social networks because the adaptation does not necessarily correspond to the often excessive expectations (but understandable) people it's rather hard in the end to say which of Mappa or Wit studio is better for snk I think that the two studios are good competitors and that in the end yes Wit studio is inseparable from snk but Mappa can conclude in a spectacular way the work and I hope that will be the case.

To conclude I really think that this season of snk is incredible on many points but which has two three defeats that said it is not what will make you not appreciate this season it is less good than season 3 P2 but really remains in the same line as the rest so I hope with all my heart that the rest (they are 1 year old) will take a higher level with less CGI that's all I ask and I beg Mappa to take his time if they have not finished so that Snk can have a memorable final adaptation for the next 10 years so that we can realize that it point Snk is a brilliant work.",2021-03-28T22:35:00+00:00,10
"Hate my review all you want but I blame the Producers for rushing the production of such a great anime: kodansha, pony canyon and production i.g - shame on you all! You all don't deserve proper nouns you money grabbers. Literal ""Money over Greatness"".Story: 10As always, that's what Isayama do best at.Art: 3The art style is good BUT THE ANIMATION IS TRASH.1) You can literally feel the downgrade from WIT Studio.Clunky CGI - The beast looks more like a Monkey Titan than a Beast Titan(if you know what I mean), less scarier(I say funny and weird) and that face looks bs. And most of thetime the CGI do not blend well on the handrawns. Felt very disappointed. Lesser frames for every fight scenes compared to the previous seasons. The trailer scenes really looks good, its just sad that they never used ANY OF IT.
2) There are some scenes specifically on Gabi with family eating dinner, where there are a lot of unnecessary movements. They should had use the time there on the fight scenes rather than dialogues that doesn't need extra movements tsk!
3) Most of the anime out there tend to have better animation quality on the Opening and Ending themes than the anime itself. But the OP and ED for season 4 felt so empty, there are a lot of repetitive frames going over and over, and they will just show smokes, explosions and and some blazing lines for like 20 seconds or more just so the screen won't go blank. And I really don't like the color schemes given, felt really plain.
4) STILL OVERALL IT'S THE PRODUCTION COMMITTEES' FAULT FOR RUSHING THE SEASON 4. They said they want the anime and manga to end at the same time but that's BS. Look, season 4 part 2 will be aired next year on January 2022 THEY DID NOT EVEN MET THEIR GOAL wtf is that??. If they had enough time then MAPPA should had done better than this, AND MAYBE if the production committee give more time to finish season 4 WIT WILL NEVER DROP THE SEASON 4.

A lot of people will say, ""come on there are a lot of good scenes other than those bad ones"" LOL! its given that an anime should have good animations especially if its a popular one and the studio making it is really big. I don't get it why are people letting themselves blinded.

Sound: 5
The opening and ending theme song is nice.
They missed a lot of opportunities for a lot of hype scenes to use that specific music, aaah! sadness.

Character: 8
They did good representing the personalities of different characters, props to Isayama there and also Mappa.

Enjoyment: 4
I think my explanation at Art gives it all why I did not enjoy it well. A lot of people will say, ""bro the important thing about aot is the story so get with it"".
Well damn, why call an anime, anime, if you're just watching it for the story, better read the manga than watch anime.

Overall: 1
I don't know why is this higher than the pervious season, is it because of recent scandals? That's why a lot are now defending Mappa and just give it a 10? or because it's ending and the last season, so we should give it all a 10?
This season doesn't deserve to be at the top ranking. SEASON 3 PART 2 IS WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY BETTER at story, music, character development, sadness, humiliation, and animation. This season doesn't really give a lot to be at the top beating some anime like FMAB. Don't get me wrong AOT is my #1 favorite anime of all time but Season 4 with that animations and little plots getting at the top?? Sorry but I have to top it down so I'm giving it a 1.",2021-03-28T21:55:00+00:00,1
"English Version:Thank you Mappa, but Shingeki no Kyojin should be bigger than that...Even before this season even started we knew the difficulties the series was having to find a decent studio to liven up, so here's my thanks to Mappa and all the animators who worked on this project running out of time, yet I believe that a work like Shingeki deserves something much bigger than it received.The animation in general is decent, the studio decided to follow the traces of the manga instead of those left by Wit which conveniently fits well with the work because of the skip team that happens since theend of the third season, the strong lines of expression in the eyes of the characters next to the dramatic charge combines well, however at certain times where it needs more varied emotions the characters end up not passing the feeling that the work wants to demonstrate, even generating jokes by the public at certain times.

In grand battle scenes the anime also has its ups and downs, while in previous seasons we have dynamic movements of the characters flying through the sky with their equipment here the studio decided to be a little more concervador and show only key movements losing some of that brightness we had when seeing the use of DMT. The focus then, stayed for the giants, maintaining a decent animation while fighting each other, it is clear that the perception of 3D is clear the moment it appears, but the studio knew how to use it decently in the night combats and in the first episode where they had a longer time to work, the same can not be said when this technique is used in later episodes or in human characters , where at certain times it becomes comical.

The story has interesting proposals but that could be better worked, the anime tries each episode to develop ideas such as cycle of hatred, slavery, historical debt and abuse of power, but the lack of depth the tornão empty and weightless subjects, when trying to develop it through different perspectives ends up failing even more to fill with conventions so that persongem X or Y feel certain independent of everything that goes against his perspective , this is quite noticeable in the development of new characters that despite having their charisma are often treated only as a force for the messy script to have the least sense, the effort for the viewer to buy the idea sometimes becomes so great that most (not to say all) of the already established characters act as doors that do not know what to think or do in the face of circumstances.

The soundtrack in general is what holds the moments of the plot, despite not returning with Hiroyuki Sawano, the new composer Kohta Yamamoto does not leave to be desired with his dramatic soundtrack and at certain scary moments, creating iconic themes from the first episode to the last, some becoming as memorable as the previous ones that are used this season at key moments.

Overall the work remains decent, but walks slowly towards an end that can be confusing or unpleasant, not by complexity but by quality, what remains is to wait for what will be delivered in the next part of the season, which fortunately will have a longer time to be drawn and put into animation!

Português/Brasil:

Obrigado Mappa, porém Shingeki no Kyojin deveria ser maior que isso…

Antes mesmo dessa temporada ter sequer iniciado já sabíamos das dificuldades que a série estava tendo para encontrar um estúdio decente para animar, então fica aqui o meu agradecimento a Mappa e a todos os animadores que trabalharam nesse projeto correndo contra o tempo, ainda assim eu acredito que uma obra como Shingeki merece algo muito maior do que recebeu.

A animação de forma geral é decente, o estúdio decidiu seguir os traços do mangá ao invés daqueles deixados pela Wit o que convenientemente encaixa bem com a obra por conta do time skip que acontece desde o final da terceira temporada, as linhas de expressão fortes nos olhos dos personagens junto da carga dramática combina bem, contudo em certos momentos onde precisa de emoções mais variadas os personagens acabam não passando o sentimento que a obra quer demonstrar, gerando até mesmo piadas por parte do público em certos momentos.

Em cenas de batalha grandiosas o anime também tem seus altos e baixos, enquanto nas temporadas anteriores temos movimentos dinâmicos dos personagens voando pelo céu com seu equipamento aqui o estúdio resolveu ser um pouco mais concervador e mostrar apenas movimentos chave perdendo um pouco daquele brilho que tínhamos ao ver o uso do DMT. O foco então, ficou para os gigantes, mantendo uma animação decente enquanto lutam entre si, é claro que a percepção do 3D é nítida no momento em que ele aparece, porém o estúdio soube usá-lo de maneira decente nos combates noturnos e no primeiro episódio onde tiveram um tempo maior para trabalhar, o mesmo não pode ser dito quando essa técnica é usada nos episódios posteriores ou nos personagens humanos, onde em certos momentos se torna cômico.

A história tem propostas interessantes mas que poderiam ser melhor trabalhadas, o anime tenta a cada episódio desenvolver idéas como ciclo de ódio, escravidão, divida histórica e abuso de poder, porém a falta de profundidade os tornão assuntos vazios e sem peso, ao tentar desenvolve-lo através de perspectivas diferentes acaba fracassando ainda mais ao encher de conveniencias para que persongem X ou Y se sinta certo independente de tudo que contraria a sua perspectiva, isso é bem visivel no desenvolvimento dos personagens novos que apesar de terem seu carisma são muitas vezes tratados apenas como força para o roteiro bagunçado ter o minimo de sentido, o esforço para que o telespectador compre a ideia as vezes se torna tão grande que a maioria (para não dizer todos) dos personagens já estabelecidos agem como portas que não sabem o que pensar ou fazer diante as circunstancias.

A trilha sonora no geral é o que segura os momentos da trama, apesar de não retornar com Hiroyuki Sawano, o novo compositor Kohta Yamamoto não deixa a desejar com sua trilha dramática e em certos momentos assustadora, criando temas icônicos desde o primeiro episódio até o último, alguns se tornando tão memoráveis quanto os anteriores que são usados nessa temporada em momentos chave.

No geral a obra continua decente, porém caminha lentamente para um fim que pode ser confuso ou desagradavel, não por complexidade mas por qualidade, o que resta é aguardar o que será entregue na próxima parte da temporada, que felizmente terá um tempo maior para ser desenhada e colocada em animação!",2021-03-28T17:33:00+00:00,6
"Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season (2021) (Part 1)Well, I had originally thought they were going to rush this out in 16 episodes and boy am I glad they did not. It was so obvious with the pacing it was a part 1, not the finale itself. The story as said does go at a fair pace but not one that is too slow just one that wouldn't cover everything so quickly. This part has been thoroughly enjoyable and I have high expectations of the true ending in part 2. The artwork was called out by many people as not to bring their desired standardor style and yet none offered to help. I must say it wasn't quite what I expected but it was still amazing. It has some areas that perhaps could do with a little more of a brush-up. 

The OST was one of the biggest issues this season too for people since they wanted to hear YouSeeBIGGIRL used at the appropriate time and as much as it is an epic score I am glad they choose to do something else. Repetition sometimes works but not always. The OP is great and the ED is amazing. The ED is something you can listen to out of the show easily. The SFX oomph is very present here. 

The characters develop massively especially with many hidden truths being brought forward. Some side characters are introduced as quickly as they leave which causes a slight issue but nothing too great to notice. 

I think when people watch it and expect it all to be rushed and wrapped up they get a lower expectation but when you realise that is not the case then you can sit back, relax and enjoy this show much more. 

Also, Pieck is the best girl end of the story. She proved herself this season to be deserving of such a title and by the blushing, many others agree too. 

10/10. It may not seem to add up but for my enjoyment was the top tier of a 10. If a 10 could be broken into 10 more tiers it would be a 10/10 of 10 for enjoyment.",2021-03-28T14:55:00+00:00,10
"(Spoilers)So after watching the trailer a thousand times I was really hyped for this season and it surely is was amazing.Story 9/10- For me, I think the story has changed a lot from a simple boy named Eren Yeager who vows to kill all titans but after he learns who been under all this hell that he and the people wall have been through he choose to sneak into the enemy home by himself learn about them and then attacks them but when it came to the lore or plot it was crazy as pieces from the previous seasons are finally linked to each othermaking things that have holes in them was jaw-dropping and I loved it.

Art 9/10- So for me, I didn't care what studies would do AOT I just wanted the anime to look good and I think MAPPA did a great job when it came to the art style as it kinda looks like the manga and it was all drawn clearly like background and character designs were amazing to see so I would like to say a great job to MAPPA for the art.

Sound 8/10- The opening I liked as I would listen to every episode as it was that good so great job to the artist to that. The ending was fine but it wasn't like opening but was still fine. Voice acting for characters were spoken clearly so no flaws in that as they would hype the anime up

Character 8/10- Eren Yeager, a boy who wants to kill all titans and someone who wants to be free. Now, I don't know if I still like Eren or hate him since his decision in the anime was something I would agree on but also hate, don't want to spoil a lot but yeah Eren should I hate or not depends if his decision is right in the future. Other characters like Mikasa, Armin, and others are still here with new characters who come to the Paradis which they learn about the outside world making them surprised and amazed about the world which was great to see. Now for the character that most people might or will hate Gabi, she, well, deserves to die as what she did can't be forgiven. So (some) characters were great to see and to see new characters were also great they also help to fit those pieces in the story.

Enjoyment 9/10- Like I said before those plot twists were amazing as if you were trying to solve a puzzle in the anime, figuring out what it what which was satisfying to see. Scenes that hyped you up for the moment like for fights or moments in the anime were great as you would want to see what happens and there were some sad parts that were sad to see but they all great

Overall 9/10- I loved the new season, the plots, the art, the great moments, and openings were all amazing and since the manga is finishing soon and the second part of the final season of AOT is coming next year makes me hyped up more to wait and see what happens as all of this will hopefully be finishing in the last part with no cliffhangers.",2021-03-28T13:32:00+00:00,9
"There's not much to say, other than what's obvious. Attack on Titan is truly heading towards being THE modern masterpiece of our generation. Everything about this part 1 was immaculate in terms of plot, pacing, direction, character, music, basically everything. I know that the animation isn't up to par with the previous seasons, but it's not like I have much to complain. In fact, sometimes I was more impressed with certain aspects then I was with Wit studio's version. The CGI, while being CGI, was actually pretty cleverly used. Plot-wise, it's pretty obvious. Hajime Isayama has truly outdone himself so far with this series. Icould have never expected it to be like this while watching the first season. The direction this has had is SO AMAZING. To this moment, I still feel the anxiety and stress that Declaration of War, Warhammer Titan and Assault episodes brought forth from me. Somehow, Reiner has become one of my favourite characters in AOT. It's only because of Isayama's genius writing and MAPPA's talent that they could have cemented those kinds of emotions.

The voice actors are just godly. Absolute god-tier. I didn't doubt the characters' emotions and actions for one second, just thanks to the incredible voice acting. Eren, Reiner, Zeke, Hange, Falco, Mikasa, Jean, AAHH!! So great. Every character feels real and alive, and it makes every emotional moment just that much more painful to experience. 

There's not that much I want to say, because I want to save some words for Attack on Titan: Final Season Part 2. This is just my in-between words of my thoughts of the show so far. Everything before episode 16 was the first huge experience of the rollercoaster, and this part pretty much ended right before the next one: the real deal is about to begin. I'm ready, Attack on Titan!! 

SHINZOU WO SASAGEYO!!",2021-03-28T13:09:00+00:00,10
"Story: 10/10. This is one of the best stories in a modern shounen. Season 4 is a testament to this, deftly addressing open plot points and questions we've had for years. It becomes clear everything since the first episode was planned out expertly, an intricately woven tapestry where everything has been intentional and planned out. This season also masterfully handles the concept of 'show, don't tell', which tends to be a problem in shounen anime. Complicated plot developments, exposition, and character development are conveyed fluidly and naturally through on-screen interactions and dialogue.And above and beyond the tight plotting and narrative is the natural introduction ofthemes of warfare, nationalism and the dangers of indoctrination. This season operates as both an incredibly entertaining piece of shounen and also an interesting delve into the dangers present in fixed mindsets of adversity and hatred. 

I think it'll be a long time before another anime like AoT hits that can nail so many aspects of good storytelling.

Art: 8/10. Due to COVID and the shorter preparation time for this season, the animation and art did tend to suffer at times. The most infamous criticism is the use of CGI.

Overall, I did not mind the use of CGI. Granted, I do prefer mostly 2d unless the CGI is hands-down incredible (like in Beastars or any Ufotable work). The CGI here is usually great, but it does stick out at times. For me, this didn't really detract from the show, as the direction was top tier. And in terms of CGI, it is definitely better than 99% of most anime CGI. 

Other than that, one small criticism I do have is towards the latter half, particularly with dialogue scenes, sometimes the art quality suffered a bit. I expect this is due to the crazy production schedule + understanding that this will be fixed in the Bluray edition.

Sound: 9/10. A phenomental soundtrack all around. The only criticism here is the tendency to overuse the trailer music at times, but given the trailer music is so good, it's not that big a deal.

Character: 10/10. One of my criticisms of earlier AoT seasons is that the characters felt flat and rather one dimensional. From Season 3 onward, this problem has been addressed and continually improved on. S4 is no exception, fleshing out characters incredibly in a short period of time. 

This is hands down the best season in terms of characterization. We get new takes on established characters, some great deconstructions on 'hero vs villain', etc. In the context of the epic scale plot, the characters have their own set of intricacies and roles to play. 

Enjoyment: 10/10. Anime of the Year for me hands down. 

Overall: 10/10. I believe after Season 3 it was clear AoT is not 'just another shounen', but AoT Season 4 truly cements it as something special. We see with this season the truth of everything behind AoT; the masterful narrative, the intricate themes, and the interesting character studies. AoT has only gotten better over time, and I think S4 is definitely a peak for the series in terms of narrative, character and thematic impact.",2021-03-28T12:49:00+00:00,10
"This is one of my favorites anime, and, although many characters die and I would like the opposite, I would not change anything about this work.Story: 10.Many people say that this season has ruined everything and that the production studio has made a mess, but in my opinion the MAPPA studio is doing a wonderful job to say the least. Yes, this part of the story is more complicated to understand and there is a lot more information, but they are explaining a lot of things and answering questions that people may have asked themselves.Art: 9.Change of studio very often, if not always, means changeof graphics and, since I was used to the previous graphics it was difficult to adapt to this recent one, but in some ways it is better. The designs seem much softer to me.

Sound: 10.
Nothing to say in particular. This anime has always a great soundtrack.

Character: 9.
I'm a person that love most hated characters and hate most loved characters. I don't know why.
But SNK is one of the few where I love almost all the characters. There are two or three characters I hate.

Enjoyment: 9.
Sometimes it is a bit slow, but they are necessary parts because they contain explanations or things that are important for the development of the story.

Overall: 10.
I love this anime so much and I would not change anything about this work.",2021-03-23T10:07:00+00:00,10
"AoT was already a great series, and somehow the 4th season (so far 13 eps in) manages to top all the previous ones. It does what a good series is supposed to by building on everything that has happened before. It really is reaching its pinnacle. The season takes place 4 years after the events of the last season. We get to see what is happening across the sea and learn about the wider world.The anime consistently keeps you engaged with its compelling story and characters. Every episode has you yearning for the next one. Just when you think the series can't offer any moremystery and twists it surprises you. 

There are numerous complaints about the art and animation, and though the quality has dropped, the storytelling is so good, it made me overlook it.",2021-03-08T17:25:00+00:00,10
"Shingeki no Kyojin has become something truly impressive. Over the course of its seasons, it slowly transformed from a post apocaliptic action series focused on people killing giants with cool gear, to a political drama full of narrative depth, sociopolitical commentary and a large cast of characters. Despite the radical tone and genre shift, it manages to tell a single, coherent story, with twists and revelations that have been hinted at from the very first episode. Story - 10The story occurs at a stable pace, speeding up as tension increases, and slowing down as it diminishes. The plot progresses organically as a result of theactions and reactions of the characters, at no point feeling like it's being forced into a particular direction. The conflicts are all carefully developed, with all sides having justifications for their positions and beliefs. One of its strongest aspects is how it manages to remain consistent while being highly unpredictable. Also, the story never fails to deliver satisfactory answers to the mysteries it introduces.

Art - 7 
The art is generally a step down from previous seasons, which is not surprising given the schedule the studio had to work with. Some scenes have characters drawn inconsistently and lack fluidity, and the complaints about the CGI are not completely unjustified. However, it is still rather good, and I'd say an improvement over the manga. 

Sound - 9
Nothing to complain here. The sound design is great, and at no point does it feel like a sound is missplaced or off. The ost fits the atmosphere perfectly. 

Character - 9
The main characters are very well written, with fleshed out motivations and personalities, while the secondary cast is somewhat less consistent, with amazing characters as well as mediocre ones. The worst are the ones that only serve a single purpose and have nothing to them beyond that, such as that marleyan officer from the first episode. Those characters have very little in terms of importance and screentime, so they don't drag down the story much. It always feels like the characters are moving the plot forward as a result of their actions, not the other way around. The way their personalities and beliefs develops according to their experiences is natural and fascinating to observe, with some changing drastically over the course of the story while others remain the same. An aspect in which characters differ, however, is the subtlety with which they're written. Some have their entire arc and narrative purpose shoved into the audience's faces, while others have more nuance and can be interpreted in several ways. 

Enjoyment - 10
This is a very subjective criteria, since there is no objetive way to determine enjoyment. This season will appeal mainly to those who enjoy political drama, stories with multiple sub-plots taking place in different locations, and those who are interested in action scenes that combine giant humanoid monsters with early 20th century military technology.  As someone who fits all of those descriptions, I've been enjoying it thoroughly

Overall - 9.5
My scores would amount to a 9 if averaged out, but I place different importance on each aspect, so I personally consider this a 9.5/10. It's an outstanding piece of fiction, that I would recommend to anyone who's looking for a well written, engaging story to consume.",2021-03-02T07:28:00+00:00,10
"Chapter 71 (11 of the fourth season) was a masterpiece, see how they showed how indoctrinated Gabi is, being her way of thinking due to the environment she lives in, not like Falco who comes from a family with a revolutionary background and that his only way to survive with Colt is to join the warriors to have a position to save them, instead, Gabi comes from a family with the thought that all eldians are demons and that you have to be loyal to Marley to be a ""good"" eldian, giving her a patriotic sense and that this is their only way to live,since the truth is that they have no other way (they would end up in concentration camps or being titans).

Gabi does not want to be a ""bad"" Eldian, which would be a demon in the Marleyan perspective, so she tries everything to follow Marley's motto and ideal. She is afraid to realize how wrong that thinking is and see her terrified face when she argues with Kaya when she realizes that her lifelong way of thinking that has helped her survive is wrong. 

Maybe there was no combat but I would say as far as development, emotions and contrast in themes like indoctrination and realizing how wrong one can be, it was wonderful.

I don't understand the hatred of Gabi as her character is very well structured and written. I can empathize with her, being just a 12 year old girl who's whole life has been to follow the ideas of a nation that thinks her entire bloodline are demons and her only way to survive in that prison is to be loyal to them.

Maybe some people say ""I wouldn't be like Gabi, I wouldn't have her ideologies or her actions"" but put yourself in her place of living in a country where your own blood is exterminated, turned into titans and that in their eyes you are a demon, it's not easy and even less for a 12 year old girl. The fear should be real in that situation and you would only seek to be able to live regardless of the consequences.

Sorry if there is a grammar error, English is not my first language.

— Spanish —

El capítulo 71 (11 de la cuarta temporada) fue una obra maestra, ver como mostraron lo adoctrinada que esta Gabi siendo su forma de pensar debido al entorno que vive, no como Falco que viene de una familia con antecedentes revolucionarios y que su única forma de sobrevivir con Colt es unirse a los guerreros para tener un puesto que los salve, en cambio, Gabi viene de una familia con el pensamiento de que todos los eldianos son demonios y que hay que serle fiel a Marley para ser un eldiano ""bueno"", dandole un sentido patriota y que esa es su única forma de vivir, ya que la verdad no tienen otra más (terminarían en campos de concentración o siendo titanes tontos)

Gabi no quiere ser un eldiano ""malo"" que vendría siendo un demonio en la perspectiva de los marleyanos, por lo que intenta de todo para seguir el lema y el ideal de Marley. Tiene miedo de darse cuenta de lo errónea que esta ese pensamiento y ver su cara de terror cuando discute con kaya al darse cuenta que su forma de pensar de toda la vida y que le ha ayudado a sobrevivir, está mal. 

Tal vez no hubo combates pero diría que en cuanto desarrollo, emociones y contraste en temas como el adoctrinamiento y el darse cuenta de lo erroneo que puede estar uno, fue maravilloso.

No entiendo el odio a Gabi ya que esta muy bien estructurada y escrita, yo puedo empatizar con ella, siendo solo una niña de 12 años que toda su vida ha sido seguir las ideas de una nación que piensa que su línea de sangre son demonios y que su única manera de sobrevivir en esa cárcel es serle fiel.

Tal vez algunos digan ""Yo no sería como Gabi, no tendría sus ideologías ni sus actuares"" pero ponte en su lugar de vivir en un país donde tu propia sangre es exterminada, convertida en titanes y que supuestamente ante sus ojos eres un demonio, no es fácil y menos para una niña de 12 años. El miedo debería ser real ante esa situación y solo buscarías poder vivir sin importar las consecuencias. 

Recién hoy (07-03-21) terminé el capítulo que se estrenó hoy y quiero poner mis ideas y opiniones sobre el capitulo 72 (13 de la cuarta temporada) 

El plan de Zeke con que todos los militares tomaran el vino para convertirlos en titanes, fue una genialidad ya que al mentir que se al tomarlo los eldianos se congelarían al instante y los eldianos al no ver que ocurría eso al tomar vino, no se lo predijeron venir. La pregunta es ¿Qué pasará con toda la gente que consumió el líquido cefalorraquídeo de Zeke?

Los padres de Sasha quien mato Gabi, le dan su perdón y ver la cara que pone me puso la piel de gallina, espero ver pronto la evolución de Gabi.

Cuando Kaya supo que Gabi quien sentía que era su amiga fue la autora de la muerte de su hermana mayor la cual admiraba mucho, me dio pena y me destrozó. 

Eren se ve cansado y destrozado a la hora de querer hablar con Mikasa y Armin, denle un respiro al pobre.

Uno de mis capítulos favoritos junto al 11 de esta cuarta temporada, esperemos que nos depara en los futuros episodios que se vendrá bien buenos.

PD: en el opening se puede ver como echan el gas del líquido cefalorraquídeo, hasta ahora todo tiene sentido en esa parte.

Cap 74 (15 de la cuarta temporada); Por fin animan la historia de Zeke, de como Grisha con el afán de librar a los eldianos pasa a llevar los de sentimientos de su hijo “Zeke” y la infancia de este, perturbandolo con que tiene que superarse a si mismo y tener que llevar el plan de sus padres.

La infancia de Zeke es horrible, el tener que escuchar como tus padres pelean porque no eres suficiente para ser un guerrero, ver el desprecio en los ojos de tu padre al verte, que dolor. Era solo un niño...

Podemos ver que Zeke piensa que Eren es igual a el, que Grisha lo uso al igual que el pero no es así, Eren tuvo una infancia más linda que el, no tuvo que tener una carga de salvar a los eldianos como lo tenía Zeke, Grisha le brindó una infancia linda con un padre presente.

Cap 75, el último de la primera parte y digamos definitivamente que Pieck se robo el capítulo. En la última escena dejaron el climax que me produjo mucho hype.

A esperar que sea Verano para ver la parte 2 y ver el retumbar.",2021-02-24T08:42:00+00:00,10
"Honestly I'm going to try to make this a honest review with no hype around it.Story - 8This is mostly a back and forth between the present and the past with maybe 2 full episodes worth of fighting. I say that bc if you take all the fight scenes so far, thats all. The rest is character drama mostly and Eren being moody. Oh and potato girl dies. Sad. I guess. Gabi amd all the others really aren't anything to right home about. To me, most of the decisions in this season really don't make much sense. For example, why they didn't just kill Gabiand the other kid didn't make much sense. And they're supposed to be under arrest in a cell with just one guard there? Nobody else? Oh right, plot armor. Other than that its pretty interesting and a fun ride definitely not 10/10 though. Can't wait for this to get the whole crunchyroll awards amd no other show. Yay...

Art/sound- 8

Honestly what is there to say? It looks and sounds great.  The CGI, while noticeable in some spots, isn't that bad anyone who is complaining should go watch ex-arms then if you think the art and cgi is bad in this. 

Characters - 7

Titans go brr. Honestly they're really isn't much change against the main cast. Eren's still moody and dense. Mikasa's still best though their isn't much competition. Levi's still short. Gabi and the rest from Marley really are just there for the plot I can't really care about any of them besides Reiner. 

Overall this whole series is a 8 at best. I'm not saying its bad but its definitely not a 10/10 and before you think it I don't think FMA is either. It's still a enjoyable series, I binged all three seasons before watching this season. Again, can't wait for ""Crunchyroll anime awards 2021 but AOT wins it all"".",2021-02-22T07:27:00+00:00,8
"this should be masterpiece, like past two season but then things happen. the studio change which resulted the majority of people who make this adaption become a masterpiece changed.The result?it's become a good adaptation, it's still a masterpiece for most people tho. but for me it's not the same adaptation anymore. besides the ending nothing really memorable about soundtrack, the animation have a lot of cg, it's okay if they just do it for small scene to reduce the budget, but no... they used those to big scene too, and from that combination resulted no scene that left me holding breath, and amazed like thepast two season. and sadly i have to dropped it after disappointed with first big scene on this final season.",2021-02-17T21:46:00+00:00,6
"First of all, this review might contains some manga spoiler on it, not really much just some monologue or dialogue that i liked.Attack on Titan, in my opinion, is arguably the best anime ever exist. It's not flawless, but it's masterpiece regardless with few flaws on it. Why? Because everything goes progressively, at the first time i watched Attack on Titan around 2014-2016 i feel like it's just an usual shonen with darker theme(with some potentials to be better than any other show). And it's literally went like how i've thought before, Attack on Titan become one of most phenomenal anime that time, hence itsjoined any other anime as the gatekeepers, which is something impressive because anime popularity competition is one of most tightest competition, just like K-Pop popularity competition.

Regarding to Season 2, i dont really found it interesting except Reiner and Bertholdt true identity, infamous Erwin's SUSUMEEE, Beast Titan existence, and Hannes death. Fortunately, those what i've found interesting are literally something so big related to the plot. Reiner-Bertholdt-Zeke identity drove us to a big reveal about actual AoT universe, Erwin ""SUSUMEEE"" also ascended to something unforgetable, and Hannes death unexpectedly plays a big role for AoT universe morality state, atleast for Eren, main character of this series. It's also applied on both cour of S3, which is considered as something really great by most peoples who already witnessed it.

Now, moving to S4, i'll start my review here:

Story - 10/10

It's really a great idea to change its theme to something more complex after Basement Reveal in S3P2. Because, the meaning of Basement Reveal is exploring a new world, which something that main casts never did before. Of course, it's stupid if the theme stays black and white because they had to interact with other countries, and you shouldn't apply black and white logic for it. You cant, actually, even if you want. It's because of diversion whether its race, ideology, point of view, purpose, fetish, even something like what netflix series you liked the most. Unless you're tolerant with others or you had enough power to force your thoughts to avoid diversion.

This is literally the main point of this season, it's all about complexity of main casts relation/connection with outside world, especially Marley.

On Marley Arc, we're given something that strengthen its plot point that we shouldnt really apply black and white logic. For example, the reason why Marley decides to invade Paradis 5 years ago drove Eren to did the same. We can call it a revenge but historically and objectively speaking, both of them are reasonable and justifiable according to some approaches and point of view. It's a black and white logic, that's why if they keep doing this on and on, it wont meet its end, until the end of the world. Of course, applying greyness logic is really hard too and it costs a lot of things.

On the next arc, this problem ascended to something even more complex than it already is. I wont tell exactly what's gonna happen but in my honest opinion, the answer that Isayama gave us was really perfect regarding to this problem. Thus why i gave it a 10.

Art - 9/10

I dont really care about my visual entertainment but i do have standard for it. In my opinion, this season deserves 9. Aside from imperfect animation, i loved character design, environment, close-ups by MAPPA more than i liked WIT version of it. It's far from bad but i had to agree with some peoples that it deserves something better.

Sound - 15/10

I'll start this with voice actings. I really really really loved their voice actings, i believe most of you agreed with this one. You can notice easily their dedication to live up their character. Yuki Kaji, Ayane Sakura, Hosoya, Natsuki Hanae, Inoue, and Kensho Ono is the best so far, atleast for me. This one aspect never failed to entertain me.

""I will keep moving forward until my enemies are destroyed"" - Hobo Eren
""THE DEATH OF YOUR MOTHER IS MY FAULT"" - Suicidal Reiner
""LAINAAAAAAAAAAH TASUKETEEEEEE"" - that loud annoying brat
""YOURE FOOLING ME MISTER KRUGER"" and ""RAINAAAAAA"" - My boi Falco
""THIS BATTLE IS OUR VICTORY!"" - King Floch

About music, no cap Boku no Sensou is a banger. It also really suits current theme of Attack on Titan. There's a lot of great OST placement too, especially Ashes on The Fire and plenty of OSTs in episode 7. But maybe i want something new from Kohta Yamamoto or Hiroyuki Sawano, something that can makes me eargasm.

Characters - 11/10

Most people thinks that Attack on Titan characters are way too cheap and they think it's bad. I thought it's the otherwise. I'm really good about knowing other person character in real life and that's why i gonna say that most of Attack on Titan character are exist on real life. Emo Eren and Levi, Cowardice Armin and Floch, Annoying Gabi, an easy-going person like Zeke and Jean, also air-headed Connie and Sasha. They dont have to be something like Meruem, Light Yagami, Johan Liebert, Kyuubey, Naruto, Kirito, Keyaru, or Pico which is well-written to be liked. Because Attack on Titan characters were actually exist in real life, they just had to be themselves to be relateable. That's why a lot of peoples feeling bad for certain character death even if their character is.cheap.

Aside from that, there's a lot of interesting and well written characters such as Eren, Jean, Zeke, Yelena, Floch, Reiner, and Gabi. Even if most peoples didnt like other character cheapness, those name i've mentioned above overshadowed it(once again this is why AoT is masterpiece because its greatness always overshadowed its flaw).

Enjoyment 20/10

The last time when my enjoyment is immeasurable was when i watched Lord of The Ring trilogy and Death Note years ago, i screamed the shit out of myself due to hype, crying over its drama, etc etc which is kinda embarassing i wont tell you guys about it. To be honest, usually i was really plain while watching films or animes, you can tell i'm setting a high standard, which is funnily slammed to the ground by Attack on Titan, really hard.

Overall 10/10

It's all really solid on every aspects, i'll give Attack on Titan about everything with 8.9 as my lowest rate, but it deserves 10 so i will give it 10. I wish i could rate it higher though.

In conclusion, my thoughts can be summarized with Levi monologue on chapter 113, which is ""Things that we have dedicated so bad has gotten us to this farce? Gimme a break!"" but in positive means.",2021-02-17T04:45:00+00:00,10
"Attack on Titan is simply the greatest anime of all time and it is really not even close. (There will be spoilers in this review.) Without mentioning anything else, the story is just simply the greatest anime story of all time. The story starts off basic but interesting and grabs your attention fast at the end of episode 1. The story is engaging, interesting, and always has you on the edge of your seat. The story may seem basic at first, but it is incredibly complex and deep. In the first season, it is amazing to see the humans vs mindless titan battles. You canfeel the characters fear and humanity's dread of the titans, which keeps you on the edge of your seat engaged in the show. There are so many plot twists in the first season, so many characters die, even the mc ""dies"" which is totally unexpected. The first season is overall amazing and foreshadows so many things to come. The second season is even better, with more plot twists, epic battles, and more mysteries. The reveal of the armored and colossal titans is one of the most bone chilling and unexpected twist in anime history. By the second season there are still many more mysteries which keeps you always coming back to watch more. The third season starts off a little slow but is necessary for the plot to advance. Season 3 part 2 however, is simply the greatest anime arcs of all time, and possibly the greatest in fiction.  Words cannot express how good it is. Every single episode had me on the edge of my seat. My heart was beating so fast every episode. I have never been so engaged in a show in my entire life. The tension in every episode between the scouts and the beast/armored/colossal titans was insane. COMMANDER ERWIN is the goat!!!!! Not only was this arc incredible because of the scouts vs the beast/armored/colossal, it was incredible because of the basement reveal. The basement reveal was the greatest plot twist in the history of fiction. I sat there staring at my screen for at least 5 minutes in utter shock after the basement reveal. What makes attack on titan so incredible is that there are so many mysteries throughout the show that get explained in a way you never see coming. The foreshadowing is there since the first season, but the reveals are still crazy and unexpected. The animation is so good, the soundtrack is incredible. The soundtrack makes all the reveals, all the fights, and all the plot twists even better. There is none of that fanservice garbage that other animes do. The characters in this show are amazing every side character is well written. Eren has amazing character development from season 1-3 and continues to develop in season 4. Every singly episode has purpose, there are no filler episodes. Attack on titan has such an amazing plot, realistic characters and setting, some of the best action scenes in all of anime, and amazing plot twists which make it easily the greatest anime ever.",2021-02-14T15:45:00+00:00,10
"Review in EnglishThe truth, I can understand that you do not like CGI. But if you're going to tell me that the story, or the ""plot"" is bad, that the characters are empty, or that they add more useless characters to the story, excuse me, but we have to meet and I have to beat you up.These energumens who put that kind of thing clearly did not read a manga in their life, and they come to SNK to look for a typical shonen or an elitist seinen, And no. SNK is unique in what it is, with a story that from beginning to endwill make sense and that is the meaning that its own creator wants to give it.

The CGI is not even that bad, you have to stop being such a crybaby, and I repeat, the story is one of the best that was seen in recent years, and I suck well the pingo evangelion, lain, berserk and cosculluela.

Isayama I appreciate you and I thank you for everything you did, and I will continue to enjoy this anime with all my love. Suck it haters go see bleach

Spanish review

La verdad, te puedo entender que no te guste el CGI. Pero si me vas a decir que la historia, o el ""plot"" es malo, que los personajes están vacíos, o que añaden personajes mas inútiles a la historia, disculpame pero nos tenemos que conocer y yo te tengo que recagar bien a trompadas.

Estos energúmenos que ponen ese tipos de cosas claramente no se leyeron un manga en su vida, y vienen a SNK a buscar un típico shounen o un seinen elitista, Y no. Tiene un historia que desde principio a fin va a tener sentido. Y es ese ""sentido"" el que le quiere dar su propio creador.

El CGI ni siquiera es tan malo, hay que dejar de ser tan bebito llorón, y repito, la historia es de las mejores que se vieron en los últimos años, y me chupan bien el pingo evangelion, lain, berserk y cosculluela.

Isayama yo te aprecio y te agradezco todo lo que hiciste, y voy a seguir disfrutando este anime con todo mi amor. Chúpenla los haters vayan a ver Bleach",2021-02-10T21:19:00+00:00,9
"Attack on Titan is an absolute masterpiece. I say that with no hesitancy, and with no doubt. Its story is so masterfully crafted from start to finish, that it remains unparalleled by any other series. It has overtaken every other series on my list of greatest anime & manga of all time, particularly for having one of the most profound, meaningful, emotional, philosophical, psychological, topical, diverse, epic, disturbing, impactful, interesting, cohesive, deliberate, inventive, and flawless stories ever conceived. It addresses and comments on an insane variety of deep & controversial topics - everything ranging from nihilism & xenophobia to governmental corruption, misinformation, propaganda, & internationaldiplomacy - and asks all the right questions regarding everything worth thinking about, from the purpose of life &amp; our shared human flaws to ambiguous morality &amp; what it means to live.

This final season encompasses the concluding arcs of the story, all of which are so flawlessly crafted &amp; presented that this series reaches an unmatched level of perfection &amp; profundity not before seen in the industry. As a manga reader, I'm aware of just how incredible this season will be, and I'm very excited to see how people react to it everything that occurs. In spite of all the crazy hype surrounding it, it will still blow away your expectations. This series surpasses its own hype immeasurably. In unfathomably incredible directions, Isayama will piss off the AoT fanbase in ways you cannot begin to imagine.

At the very start, everything might feel very foreign &amp; disconnected from everything you've come to expect from the series based on its past seasons, as if it was dropped on you like titans from the sky. But this is by design - you have been thrust into the world beyond the Walls just as suddenly as our main cast has been, so the uncomfortable feeling is deliberate. Rest assured, everything you witness plays a substantial role, and was the best possible route the story could have gone in, so take in all the little details and appreciate the expansive world-building that takes place.

So far, the anime has adapted the manga perfectly, nearly panel for panel, which is always highly appreciated, so I give them lots of credit for pulling that off while still embedding it with some of their own style. They've imbued even many low-key moments with meaningful cinematographic flair that improves the artistic standard of the series. The animation quality holds up well for the most part - some scenes look amazing, others not as much, and CGI is utilized particularly well with some of the best &amp; most convincing integrated CGI I've seen used in anime. Despite the CGI which some might complain about, this is still high-quality enough that it can even be up for debate which animation style is better. Personally, I still much prefer WIT Studio's style over this. But the quality is here enough to alleviate concerns about the final season being mishandled under a new studio, and so I'm confident &amp; hope that they can deliver on the series' climactic emotional moments and immense payoffs.

Either way, you're in for one hell of a mind-blowing ride, so sit back and enjoy the unforgettable experience of a lifetime.",2021-02-09T10:19:00+00:00,10
"My Lord isn't this Overhyped. Well mostly because of the surface level anime community which flogs over for shows like these once in a while, yes. This is the best season anime has ever witnessed, Hell this season alone is better than all the top grossed shows combined from last year. There's so much content that it's impossible for me to catch up with everything, being reasonable with my life choices and priorities. And here comes the final season of Attack on Titan, the artwork is fine it does it's job, but I could have really appreciated if they would have taken some more timewith the adaptation, making the cg blend in well, because whenever I notice those jarred 3D models, I'm completely thrown out of any immersion. Story seems fairly well built, nothing's so revealing to me or maybe I've just gone quite less sensitive to these things. Then again to me this is mediocre content. Mind you I'm not talking about it in terms of anime, This is my perspective while comparing this with the forms of media I generally consume. I'll give this an eight tho it deserves like 7 or something, then again the relevance of seeing an all time classic is a grand premise and I'm not sure when I'll witness it again, so here I'm rating you an '8'.",2021-02-08T00:20:00+00:00,8
"Is AOT season 4 a masterpiece? NO. Is it bad? NO. Is it overhyped? YESAOT season 4 is a solid adaptation by MAPPA. The CGI was meh, it was ok at best. The soundtrack was a little bit of a downgrade. The story of course is the best part of the show.Art 6/10 Is the art good? Yes. But compared to the previous seasons it's a downgrade. The CGI is probably what keeps me away from enjoying this season. The CGI is stiff, it doesn't blend in with the 2d background, and the models are mediocre. The previous seasons had CGI but that's just thecolossal titan and that's the only nitpick I have with the other seasons.

Story 9/10
The story is the best part of the show. It's why I'm still watching this season. 

Character 7/10
Gabi is kinda annoying but she's a good character. The new characters are ok but they're not amazing

Enjoyment 7/10
I like this season even though it has a lot of flaws.

Overall 7/10
It's good,  I enjoyed it. There's nothing else to be said about it.",2021-02-07T23:08:00+00:00,7
"This anime has come a LONG way from when it debuted in 2013, and it has so far been a very dark, gory, and tragic, but it has also been a very bright, beautiful, and hopeful journey as well. This has easily been one of the most enjoyable shows to come and since then has lived up to the hype season by season! This new season has EVERYTHING to be excited about!!Art: 10A lot of fans have been giving flak to the final season of Attack on Titan for its art style, but Mappa have been ON POINT with VERY careful attention to detail foreach scene. A lot of people dislike the new look for Mikasa (AoT fans Waifu) even though it's 100% accurate bit by bit as shown in the manga. Mappa has done a great job animating the fight scenes as well even with the CGI scenes, which normally I hate in anime, but is exceptional with Attack on Titan since it is done very well so far. The color, the lighting, and animation are up to par that will satisfy the every fan, viewer, and new-comer.

Story: 10

The follow-up of the story of the final season is fantastic and takes a turn that NO ONE (besides manga readers) saw coming! It's surprising, different, and daring, but it's all cohesive which is the best part! The set-up for the climax of this season is very well done and slowly builds up the intensity episode by episode.The cliff hangars in some episodes are just perfectly timed to where you're just DYING for a week until the next episode arrives to figure out what happens. Classic Attack on Titan move as always. It also has flashbacks that give even more explanation of events that happened in previous seasons that add more details and background to characters. Truly a masterpiece in writing!

Sound: 10

Quality of the music is outstanding as always, nothing new here! Voice acting is just as good as usual. Sound effects from conversations to fight scenes are done just as well, no complaints here.

Characters: 10

It will introduce the good ole characters that we all know and love, but it will also introduce new characters that are transparent to show the striking similarities that reflect characters from the previous seasons. These new characters are introduced with a necessary purpose to show the duality and similarity of man. Even though they are enemies, they are also one of the same as well. With that said, Eren Yeager has aged both physically and mentally, and he shows himself as a calm, collected, and contemplative individual, BUT he is also still forthright and adamant on his goals just as before. This will play a very important part in future episodes to come!

Enjoyment: 10

Every time a new episode comes out, I can't help myself but to listen to the intro all the way through. At first, I hated it and thought that the previous intros were better. After a few episodes, it grows on you like no other, and it gets stuck in your head! The intro is perfect for the season, and it makes you imagine the horrific, shell-shocking, and grueling things to come but in a very exhilarating and intense way! This is the final season, the big fight, the last stand, the end, this is war! I have NOT been disappointed yet whatsoever, and the adrenaline keeps going on what's going to happen next! No anime season has made me this excited in a long while, and it shows with the huge number of new-comers loving the show and joining the ride.




Overall, this season has been living up to the hype and is delivering as promised! As said before, I wait every week just to see a new episode of Attack on Titan. This is easily one of the best shows of all time, and a amazing recommendation for any anime viewer! Even if you don't watch anime and are new to the scene, this is a MUST WATCH without a doubt!!",2021-02-07T15:16:00+00:00,10
"My overall opinion on the story is that Shingeki no Kyojin is a modern classic, it takes so many aspects of what people consider justifiable and turns them upside down. Isayama shows that theres no objective right and wrong in the world of Shingeki no Kyojin. This season has already shown us the massive shift and changes in character development. Figures like Jean, Eren, Reiner and Armin show a massive shift in character. They aren't the way they used to be and it shows. Isayama shows the real life effects of war on people, from Reiners post traumetic stress disorder to oppersion and interment ofthe Eldians still in Marley. Racism, suppremacism and indifference to rules of war are very well portrayed. Isayama has written Marley as something akin to Nazi Germany.

In short I love the real world parallels Isayama draws and the devotion to the characters he's supplied. Truely a modern masterpiece.


My opinion on the art and animation: It could've been better, but that's not the fault of the animators. I really wished AoT got another year of development. Regardless of that, with the time constraints and outside pressure Mappa did a phenominal job. The CGI is implementen in less important scenes and the highlights are animated as they should be. To give important details like that priority shows the team knows what people want and understands the audiences expectations.


The OST has been phenominal as always, helping stir up emotions at important scenes, I can't go too much into them without some spoilers but the music really fits those scenes where its implemented. Really happy they didn't reuse the same music from the previous seasons. Season 4 just has a different vibe to it, one that does NOT fit the OSTs from previous seasons.


Characters: What can I say, even Connie, a character I thought was shallow has some great development already in this season. Can't go into detail without spoiling the rest.

Overall a great season so far, keep up the good work MAPPA",2021-02-06T04:26:00+00:00,10
"SPOILERSAOT S1=8/10   |   S2=8.5/10    |   S3 PART 1=8.7/10  |S3 PART 2=10/10   |   AOT FINALE SEASON ( for now) =8/10Im a big die-hard fan of AOT, when i watched the first season i tought it was mediocre, i didn't see nothing special about it, it was just some people that didn't even have a motivation or anything to kill the titans, it had alot of plot holes, alot of problems, i tought it was wasted potential because i felt like aot had the main source but couldn't develop it right, but boyi was wrong...
At the end of season 1 when we find out about annie being the female titan, it started to be interisting, but yet i had alot of questions like how annie is a titan? Is annie  friends with the other titans? Where did she come? Did a titan and human married and gaved her to birth thats why she is a titan and a human at the same time? Then i watched season 2 and my question still weren't solved but yet that season shows the big betrayal between Reiner and bertoto, when they revelead they were the colossal titan and armored titan, i was shocked , but when reiner,ymir, bertoto kidnapped eren and then they say they are going to a special place i was shocked and yet super interisting, but then as always eren has alot of plot armour so he got saved .season 3 answered to all my problems, season 3 showed what attack on titan was actually or most titan of attack , amazing season 3 part 2 Of AOT might be the best season out all anime i have at lateast watched!

Now going to review this season:


STORY 8/10 (for now, depends on the ending):

no complains, after eren finding the truth now he is going to destroy the world , since the truth is finnaly revelead (i think) i bet that theres not gonna be any more big plot twist like the plot twist at the end of season 3, now this seasons is more too see whos gonna die and what's gonna happen to the world after the big war, but im afraid that this season isn't gonna exciting as s3 part 2, since s3 part 2 had really big plot twist and wasn't just that , the dialogue, animation everything on that season was just perfect, but this season started as confusing i didn't know who were the kids at the begin also im still confused about certain things, but then after some episodes they start to explain everything and it starts to make sense, but since like i said we finnaly discovered the truth so it will not be exciting anymore as the previous seasons. The thing that i am most excited for this seasons, is too see how AOT is gonna end! 

ANIMATION/SOUNDTRACK: 4/10

my problem here isn't the ccg titans, i tought that the ccg here was perfectly fine and better than WIT cgg, my problem here is how the humans move, i remenber on episode 2 when gabi was dinning with her family talking about what she did before in the war, the way she moved it was very weird, i can't tell if they used cgg on people too, but what i know is that gabi was moving very weird in that episode, and wasn't just that moment, there were more moments were the animation seemed sketchy!
Also i couldn't feel any motion or anything in mappa artsyle/animation like i felt with WIT, WIT animation was like the beautifully in every way you could imaginate, every fight in AOT had alot of emotion also how WIT did AOT atmosphere is was just amazing, Also i loved how the atmosphere changed per moment, like when levi vs beast titan the atmosphere felt dry and bland because since we lost alot of lives but really alot in that day, it was a sad day yet WIT could perfect bring even more emotion by puting a dry atmosphere on that season, amazing also how everyone eyes felt like the freedom, the eyes how bright they were in a terrible word that makes no sense AMAZING, but yet mappa brings no emotion, even in the moments that should have emotion yet mappa doesn't bring anything, if i would discribe the animation and soundtrack on this season i would say its dry bland and meh. Also how terrible the animation is at lateast for the humans for me, the titans cgg is okay for me i am not a big fan on cgg.

Characters (7/10)
Its only like 7 eps but i felt like the scouts cast felt generic, falco is obssesed with gabi but my problem is why he is so obssesed with her? And gabi seems the generic girl whos just crazy and wants to win everything yet is playfull, falco is the generic boy obssesed over a girl because for like no reason? He didn't had any depth on this season, as the others i dont remenber their names and also i don't care cuz i didn't find the new cast interisting in any way.
As eren and mikasa and armin and the others are still the same they just changed because they finnaly find the truth! Eren i think he is kinda edgy for now but he has a reason for that!
I still don't understand why mikasa is so obssesed with eren but i think we never gonna get a proper explanation for that.
Armin is incridible he was one of the characters in the show that got depth and development from the start!

ENJOYMENT(7/10)
i really don't like the new cast that much, im not a big fan of the new artsyle since i will not feel any emotion again because like i said WIT didn't just did incridible animation but like they also add alot of emotion in every fight, i could litteraly feel what levi was feeling when he was fighting the beast titan, the atmosphere was just amazing i swear its a honour too see that amazing artsyle of AOT in the first 3 seasons, as this season the artysle feels generic because Aot first 3 season had a original artsyle will this one feels generic, also i hate how ugly their faces are, the noses are horrible.
but my enjoyment for now is a 7 because  i am really excited too see the ending of AOT .

OVERALL (8/10)
i wouldn't mind wait for 2 years for a proper adaption with a incrible animation that could litteraly capture every moment with loads emotion and also with that amazing atmosphere, i don't understand why the creator wants the anime to end the at the same time as the manga? Didn't he saw what happened to tokyo ghoul Va/RE and berserk 2016?
Also its cringe how the fans say that the animation of this season is better than the previous seasons, its super cringe that the fans lies to theirselves just because attack on titan is their favourite anime of all the time, myself has a die-hard aot fan i can't lie, the animation of this new season is avarage at the best or eve lower, yeah i know mappa only had 10 months but do you know what? I really don't care , i want someting appealing to watch, attack on titan isn't attack on titan with that WIT animation and artsyle and also that amazing soundtrack, look what happened to Tokyo ghoul RE  it had a really sad and good story yet the artsyle looked like the art of a generic harem and the animation was terrible, the moments that meant to be sad they weren't because the art and animation didn't bring any emotion, i think thats what happening to the new season of AOT?

I never cried to a anime till i watched AOT, yea i know Aot has alot of plot holes, alot of flaws, alot of terrible choices (when they saved armin and not erwin) alot of missing character development, alot of plot armour to the main cast but YET who cares?
For me a masterpiece isn't a flawless anime but a anime with a mind blowing story and that makes you interest every episode and that gets better every way, 
I never got interest in any anime has i was with AOT, i have watched all the top animes ranked on MAL and i can tell you none of these make me excited and emotional as AOT, even tought all of these probaly have less flaws than AOT yet none of them make me gave any feeling of excitement to see the next and next episode, most of the time  generic harems are more interisting that most animes, myself has a person who puts enjoyment above everything because anime was made to entertain people not to be goot writted, but AOT was one of the few animes that proves that enjoyment and writting are equally, i can't lie there were some boring episodes in AOT but yet the story and plot was just so interisting i was so invested that i really didn't care i just wanted to watch more and more, 50 eps in AOT felt like 20 eps because i was just so invested,  the episodes felt slow paced but at the same time fast paced, i love it.!
Yeah i know that AOT uses shock value to keeps the audience interested, i know that AOT could have ended in like 30 eps if the author didn't slow paced it by putting some useless dialogue and by mading a full ep of a backstorys of a characters just to them to die the next episode, yeah i know that AOT has alot of flaws, but do you know what i really don't care! I never got interest in a anime has i am with AOT!",2021-02-02T14:39:00+00:00,8
"Honestly, I love aot, its the first manga I kept up with on a monthly basis, and it definitely shaped what i look for in an anime today, so here comes the question, is it any good?Well, good is subjective, if you came into this show because of the high octane action, then you might not like this season. It’s a long departure from season 1 where there are fights every episode; I’m okay with that. The story has enthralled me. While the main mystery of the basement has been revealed, I’m still impressed enough with the story to continue this train, wherever it mightlead us. I’m perfectly fine with the usage of cg, because it still looks pretty alright all things considered, and the rest of the categories make up for that twofold. Would I recommend AOT? Yes.",2021-02-02T07:26:00+00:00,10
"This is my first written review here, although the score can surely change throughout the second half of this season, I barely think my mind will change. First of all, I don't read the manga, so my score is based on what has happened till episode 7.That said, I think we are good to go.STORY - 10/10""Who is the real enemy?"" - If I met my 2018 self, back when season 3 started, and said that SnK would reach the point where we are now, I would've laughed. The amount of care put into the world building and the structure of the story is, alone,motive enough for me to love it. I always liked the subtle and swift story changes from season to season, how it would change the focus and basically it's whole point in a few episodes. This is the strongest point of this anime/art work to me, definitely. I loved the feeling of uncertainty that every ""to be continued"" passed, not knowing what would happen next episode, and this season is not behind it in any way, shape or form.

ART - 10/10
The art work of MAPPA is absolutely great and has actually passed far high my expectations. Though not a big fan of CGI, it looks awesome most of the time, and the direction team is simply brilliant. The close ups, the timing of the scenes, everything. In that aspect I'm a little suspect to discuss, as I love the blur brought to this season, and the gray-ish aspect of the art itself. Aside from that, I got really used to the new designs and really loved them, but this is completely personal opinion, and I understand anyone who dislikes the changes.

SOUND - 9/10
Another controversy of this season, mostly the use of OST. Mostly manga readers were furious that Sawano's Youseebiggirl"" wasn't used in THAT scene. Surely that would be epic, but to me, 2Volt was really on point to build the despair passed from that scene. It was not made to be epic, at least, it's what I got from it. The 9/10 comes from the overuse of the new (in)famous ""Ashes on the Fire"", which I really love, but expected a lot more, as the expectation bar was really high from past seasons. That aside, the sound design itself is amazing, voicework is on point and the buildups never let you down, especially episode 7, which used the OST perfectly.

CHARACTERS - 10/10
Probably my biggest surprise this season was the character build, which, to be honest, was never the big point of SnK. But that changes completely this season. First, Reiner becomes one of the most complex characters in any fiction work I've seen. I loved it. And right after it was Eren's time to shine. I won't get deeper than that because... spoilers, but the point is, the only weakpoint of this work imo, is no more.

ENJOYMENT - 10/10
It's hard to remember the last time I haven't had goosebumps watching this show. ""Enjoyment"" is really hard to define, essentially because throughout every episode I feel a rush of emotions. Sadness, excitement and despair in such a short amount of time, that I can't help but imagine that my life expectancy is decreasing.

OVERALL - 10/10
This is it. SnK is my favorite fictional piece of art ever, and I am extremely happy to follow and consume this art for around 6 years now. I normally wouldn't review something without the end, GoT taught me that, but to me, the adventure itself has been so amazing, that I don't imagine the ending screwing everything. All in all, this season is absolutely amazing, and I feel truly bad for those who dropped it on season 1 thinking it would be another basic shonen.",2021-01-30T17:38:00+00:00,10
"This is the 3rd tme i'm editing this review,and i hope it is the last one.Before we begin,let's note a few things:-spoilers for episodes 1-9 and beyond,in the manga.-manga reader here!up to the latest chapter(137).Been waiting for this season for almost half an year-100% my opinion.If you disagree with this review,let me know!My profile is publicWithout any further ado,let's review this hell of a rideStory 8.5-9/10Attack on Titan has been so far a masterpiece.I deeply believe that one day it will be considered a modern classic.Altough i feel that the last 2 arcs(marley warriors and war on paradise)in other words,this season is a little bitof a downgrade from previous seasons.Just a little,i still like it.It all changed with the revelation in s3,that there was no titan apocalypse at all.It is quite an interesting take,i didn't expect this at all.It really does feel like a different anime,very militaristic,not so many titans.The main themes of this season are freedom and justice.Not so much to say about freedom,makes sense that people between the walls want their freedom.The second theme is much more interesting tough.It presents us two groups,two countries who have been enemies from ancient times:Marley and Eldia,and it provokes us into some deep toughts.Who is right?
We know that Marley hates eldians,opress them and use as war weapons.Lots of people look at this and imidiatly jump on Ereh's size because racism bad.However,Marley has their reasons too and people choose to overlook this aspect.Eldia has been opressing other nations and killed them with the power of titans for almost 2,000 years.Only 100 years prior to the series begining did they stop.So,in my opinion,neither side is doing anything wrong.It's a never endind cycle of hatred,a very smart dillema and tought provoking aspect.
Characters 10/10
Now this is where this season truly shines.Eren has gone trugh some massive character development.From the hokage dattebayo brat to an enigmatic anti-hero.Altough i disagree with pretty much everything he's doing,it's still a good character,maybe an even better one than before
We saw Zeke's true colors,he wasn't a dirty little snitch after all.His plan later on in the series is the most logical solution to the eldian crisis.Armin is like a miniature Erwin sometimes,my man went from mama's boy to mama's man.Mikasa is kinda the same,i just hope her simping for Eren will stop,seeing what he did.She does look like a man tough.Sasha looks gorgeous,so it's a shame that Isayama nerfed Mikasa.The new warriors:Gabi is annoying.I don't hate her for kiling Sasha,she's just like a pest.Falco is very mature for his age,and i think the focus should've been more on him than on that little rat.Udo and Zofia are just there most of the time,and they eventually die early on in the story to give Gabi a reason for revenge.I'm not sure how to feel about Reiner,he looks tired all the time.
Sound 9/10
Nothing to special here.It's good.They kinda overuse the trailer music,but it's still a banger
Animation 7.5-8/10
Meh.....
1)They used CGI.Good CGI,i can't lie.But it's still CGI,and making the titans,the main focus of the series in 3D is not so good of a choice.They look decent most of the time.They move and fight bad.Reiner in ep1 runs like a wounded deer.Way too fast and chaotic for a titan covered in armor plates.In ep6,Eren's punches on the warrhammer have a ridiculous recoil,they look almost robotic.They even did the scout in CGI,and they looke d awful.It's a shame,because MAPPA is a very good studio.Jujutsu Kaisen looks amazing,and if given enough time this season could've been a masterpiece.However,they accepted the ridiculous time line of 8 months.They honestly should've said no or demand for more time.Fans have waited 4 whole years for s2.4 Entire long years for 12 episodes.I would've gladly waited 1 even 2 more years for MAPPA to take their sweet time and do this season justice

Overall:it is good.And that's the problem.Good is not enough for attack on titan.Guys,let's be real,it could've been better.I still have hope for part2 or whatever they decide to make after this season ends,hope that theyll take their time instead of finishing it as fast as possible for the consoomer normies who can't wait 1 more year for an anime.Good seaso,could've been better.8 out of 10",2021-01-27T02:28:00+00:00,8
"Oh boy! It's a Attack on Titan (dere it iz!), new season and the last one. It maybe only 7 episodes thus far (from when I write this), but dude it's fantastic. The Final Season starts-off with an interesting parallel to the first season of AoT. Showing the audience Meriyan life with child leads, just like Eren, Armin and Mikasa, helping you to understand the insanity of this world. Forming into a slow burning build, to a monstrous explosive *BOOOM*—then the shit smashes the fan!MAPPA takes up the reins for this seasons production, and they've done a great job, contrary to what some may believe.In terms of storytelling and the scene selection from the manga it's all top notch! With that said though, one of the major issues in-my-opinion is the pacing. It's speeding through a lot in such a short amount time, not letting somethings simmer or to build-up atmosphere, but I was expecting that since it's a 16 episode season rather than the 24 I was hoping for (I read the manga, hehe).

One of the other issues I had with the anime, was the editing and placement of the OST. It always seemed to be a little off tempo, especially in comparison to the animation. Personally, I think that might be due to the grandiosity of its composition. Though, the music separately, I absolutely love, that demonic sounding choir is just sex for my ears! &lt;3

At this point, I'm waiting for the character progression of the main leads; Eren, Mikasa and Armin. I think it's going to be a lotta fun and the ride will be orgasmic!

With this quickly done, if I had to give a 1/10 scoring, it'd probably fall under a solid 8/10! It's definitely a must watch—even it does have some titanic haters on the Twitters.",2021-01-26T09:01:00+00:00,8
"_This review will be on the technical aspect of this season. The story will be excluded.  I will make a full review when all episode have been aired._ED and OP:Both Studio did a well job on using songs and visuals for the OP/ED to match the theme of the show. The best are 'Sasageyo' OP from season 2 and 'Shock' ED from season 4. Sound effect: Unlike Studio WIT; MAPPA did a mediocre or (let say) an awkward job on using the sound. Some of the recorded sound doesn't match few action. Like when the Eren rip apart the cord that was attached withthe Warhammer Titan which Wilbur's crystallized sister was using the Titan from. When Eren tear it apart it mean a sound as it was soft tissue being ripped not a huge nervous cord at least a meter thick in diameter, which clearly had tough muscle. Since it was underneath a lot of rubble and didn't looked damaged.

Music choice and it's execution:

Studio WIT did the greatest job of using the perfect music to match the theme by using every instrument they have in disposal to create different style of song to fit the moment. Like when we are shown Grisha's past the music change to Jazzy with guitar like of 1920s music. Which perfectly fit for town in the same era he grown up in. Making us feel his nostalgia. 

 But it not just matches the moment; also enhances the mood and the hype. Thanks to composer Hiroyoki Sawano and the music director. The music perfectly hit key note and beats coordinating with scene making the moment more mind blowing and breathtaking. Like season 2 revealing of Reiner and Bertholt reveal scene. It didn't just shock many viewers but blow them away. It was a epic. Or my favorite Beast Levi vs Zeke's Titan. 

(Watch this video with no other audio apart from the full OST of the fight with the scene to see the use of music composition and direction.) 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Raufri3ShFs

But even though Hiroyoki Sawano staying for the final season; it not just didn't go even more insane as every season. But wasn't as good as the previous season. They are just music matching the mood of the scene. Which is not good since it doesn't live up to the expectation for many. Maybe it was the music director fault. But for now it won't change that MAPPA didn't do a better job. Even if they did a good job. Change of theme is not an excuse. Also, they milked the war soundtrack to much.

Use of CGI:

(Watch this video first for reference.)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24yw-5YvIGk&amp;t=29s

Studio WIT used CGI but they didn't overuse it. They mainly did to animate Rod Reiss and the Colossal Titan. But not just they did to animate every Titan's important scenes; they did in a poor way to compare it some Anime that are combination of 2D and 3D animation. And some scene are fully CGI in general. Unlike some show few things are CGI but other are drawn. And combine in such way they are tolerate able. Also, WIT only had 34 employees that were working on this. SO, even if the details look bad it could have been better if the producer have increased their budget. And their use of CGI is way better with better camera angles and moment. And great transition from 2D to 3D.

For example, the overuse of CGI combine with poor camera angle made the Armor Titan look weightless. Now compare it to other 3D Anime like 'Kengan Ashura'. We can imagine of the attacks pain and impact. Making us feel uncomfortable just by looking at few scene. 

Studio WIT not just animate most of the scene but used dynamic camera shot. While MAPPA gave us weird POV scene. Let's not forget the scout using their gear were drawn in previous seasons. But in here they used CGI on them also. Making them look like stiff model not actual expressive one. New CGI shows like Levius and AJIN have use better CGI model. It's not like they didn't had nay choice. Plus they movement is not fluent and fluid not just like the previous season but compare to many CGI shows in general.

Art Style and the 2D animation:

Compare to Studio WIT the art style look downgraded. But it actually suite the theme of the current show. The drawn version of 5 Titans in this season are better looking. Not for this season but in general. But some of the difficult scene were drawn in for a second to begin with was because they were trying to use these scene to make the trailer. In reality those scene aren't used in the show. It was CGI instead. So, it won't turn of the general viewers away from watching the season to begin with after seeing the CGI.

The only complain I have is that few characters like Mikasa doesn't look normal. Like Mikasa look like man. And that do not have anything to do with the hair cut. 

Execution:

Well this is no doubt it the director did a mediocre job. He didn't help increase the suspense or hype at all. And change of theme isn't an excuse also here. Some fight sequence end quickly and some executed poorly

Conclusion:

So, was all this excusable because of budget, time constrain and the plague going around ? Not really. MAPPA had the animators that could have animated all the scene with the CGI. If we look at 'God of Highschool'  animation. It was fluid, with great choreography, consistent, and had a great art style. 

So, they blow their budget it on adapting to many shows that it effected the technical issue of this season. And everyone else too. They tried to adapt shows whose source material no one care about and didn't had potential to do a decent job (not even hidden gem). Instead of taking it's share and spending on other shows many people are looking forward too. 

Even 'God of Highschool' was failed adaptation. With a rushed story even WEBTOON fan hated it. And Anime only fans were disappointed or bored. Plus, all that could been fixed if they had delayed it. Didn't WIT took 4 years to finish season 2 after releasing season 1. And it still was a hit. Since, it was on it's high of it popularity. In order to make sure it was release when they didn't loose even a bit of popularity. So, it was rushed; to make money instead of making many while creating shows with passion. 

Games like 'Silent Hill 1 &amp; 2' were delayed a lot. After missing deadlines they finally were able to finish it and the result was a successful game. 

How are we suppose to consider this as a masterpiece if are just grateful it was even animated. It is a show where even if you lack funds the fan would have raise some money. So, why didn't you ? Not like you didn't that the employee to begin with compare to WIT; only 34 employees great the whole first 3 season while you had 200+ employee from with 100 could have given to work on this while you work on other big titles. And even the time wasn't the matter. Even if you have waited 2 years instead of year and half it wouldn't had bother anyone. 

If you ask us to be grateful of it even been animated then it's like asking for us to be happy for 'Game of Throne' season 8 for existing to begin with. Which was a badly written show. That would be asking us to accept mediocrity. Instead of having opinions.

If we ignore the story I will give this a 70/100.",2021-01-24T07:06:00+00:00,7
"Characters, music, plot... I wouldn't know where to start. I used to watch anime and series during all my life, but I stopped firmly because everything was just overhyped for no reason and ended up in the worst possible way most of the time.But this, this is the product of a super human. I can't believe all the goosebumps I get watching every single episode. Every detail, even the smallest one, is in its place, accurate, well prepared. I cannot even think the hard work that has to be behind this masterpiece.Nonetheless, what surprised me the most was the whole story, it's insane, it's unimaginableto be honest, an endless twist (A COUP DE THEATRE!!!).

I pray and hope that as many people as possible could watch it and enjoy.
Attack on titan overcomes the concept of series or anime, and stands right in an higher level, alongside with Breaking Bad (The only show which comes to my mind that gets close). Out of any ranking. Out of any critic. What a time to be alive...

May this piece of art become the most rated serie of all time, with a 10 out of 10. And may the next generations watch it and remember it forever.",2021-01-20T14:45:00+00:00,10
"(Spoilers for the first three seasons of Attack on Titan)(Also this review is mainly about the Attack on Titan series as a whole)Attack on Titan season 4 the final season of the masterpiece of an anime that is Attack on Titan and oh boy I wanna talk about it so let's talk about it.Story: 10Attack on Titan has a really good story and why is that? This is because of the twists in the story. The story is not predictable. One moment your favourite character could be written off in one episode or a character's goals and ideals can essentially flip in the span ofan episode, that's what keeps the story fresh it keeps us on the edge of our seats also the cliffhangers compels us to keep watching the anime, to know what happens next. One thing I have noticed is that the story is not all focused on one thing, sometimes it's killing titans, sometimes it's more development of this world inside the walls or even small scenes like levi cleaning now this helps in better world building and the story not feeling all that bland and boring  after a while of killing titans. Now I am a manga reader so I know what's gonna happen next in the upcoming episodes and seeing mappa following the manga chapters very closely and adding scenes of their own just adds to this beautiful story of Attack on Titan.

Wit after doing their amazing job for the animation for the  first three seasons of Attack on Titan, now it's time for Mappa to tackle the animation for the final season. Fans such as myself were kinda worried about Mappa taking over after wit did this amazing job for the first three seasons but after watching the first ep Mappa has done it again with their amazing animation and the cinematography is simply outstanding but I have to say the cgi can be a bit offsetting at first but it's not bad by any means.

Sound: 9
Can't complain much here, the openings, endings and osts are all really good.

Characters: 9
It's no surprise that the series has quite a bit of character development. Out main characters having been getting more and more developed each season and the characters introduced in the later seasons have also received character development so they don't just feel like cardboard cutouts as compared to our main cast.

Enjoyment: 10
By far I have been really enjoying Attack on Titan. The first three seasons I absolutely loved it, I still remember the days when people used to make theories about 'what's in Eren's basement?' after watching the absolute godly season that was season 3 part 2 I read the manga and am having a good time watching the final season this feels like I am watching a classic being made infront of me also it's really disheartening to hear people harassing animators and directors just because of the cgi and not putting the music they thought would have been more appropriate for the scene so people who do this please stop it there are other ways of expressing your dissatisfaction by not going this far.

Overall: 9

"I give it 6i don't really enjoy the animation that much, not like the last season where i feel like every episode feels like just a minute since i got hooked up so much from the anime, and that because the animation quality is really good. this season is pretty bad with the CGI and the art quality, the titans looks Robotic more than Titanic ( or like a normal titan) and it makes me cringe a little bit. As for the story, i think it's good for the start of the season 4. Reiner and his titan origin is what i wanted to knowmost. and that's what i can say right now since the anime still ongoing, and i can't wait to know the story more.

this is for the episode 6, the fight was not as good as i expected, the Transformation animation was Omega Good but the fight is so robotic and pretty bad, i would prefer the humans fight than the titans fight, but most of the time was the titans. and i can't really enjoy the episode much",2021-01-18T16:08:00+00:00,6
"Animation is way better in the other seasons and there is overuse in CGI and is unneeded, WIT Studio gave us the hype with its beautiful style and animation with direction and music to make AOT best moments, Mappa fails to capture the style WIT had which is fine but the unneeded CGI is lazy and ruins impact of scenes. WIT have demonstrated how amazing 2d is for titans and their use of gradient shading to aid the horror aspect of the show and use of music... this season is only good for the story but fails in every other aspect, Mappa's 2d animation isgood but not as good as WIT and fails to recapture attack on titans best artistic traits and uses rotoscoping for many scenes that look ridiculous most notably in episode 2. This definitely not higher than the 8 so far as they failed to even play good music as Eren transformed earlier in this season and music does make attack on titan as collosal and armor betrayal and the squads death and Erwin's last speech were all through the music. If you fail to see this then you are blinded by the hype, every last season deserved this hype and love but this season is overated, even part 2 i currently better.",2021-01-17T06:24:00+00:00,8
"This review does not contain any spoilers for people who haven't read the manga. I figured I'd preface the review with this because the hype for the season is huge, so I'd understand why people would refrain from reading any reviews.With that in mind, I guarantee you that this season, and whatever follows it, is going to contain some immense action. There's a lot that goes down, and I don't know how much longer AOT is going to continue to be animated. There's a lot of material that needs to be finished, but as of right now, AOT is delivering pretty well.Isayama is one ofthe best storytellers who has constantly been working on his storytelling ability, as you can see the drastic changes of the art style and the storywriting which is top tier. There are not many anime out there that can draw out such dark and complex themes as well as AOT can. The world feels real and there are drastic measures that must be taken in order to survive in a cruel world. However, just like the real world, the ones with wealth and status have no need to fight, rather, they command others to do the dirty work for them. Speaking with such real themes allows for AOT to feel real. You care for the people of this world, and with incredible characters and an incredible world, AOT is probably one of the best ""real"" anime.

The art is incredible, but of course, MAPPA knows how to utilize techniques like rotoscoping in order to achieve nice shots, that take a while to get used to due to the divergence from still shots (used by Studio WIT in earlier seasons) and some breathtaking CGI. People have different tastes, but I think the CGI goes well with the hand-drawn animation, and doesn't stick out too poorly. The average watcher wouldn't find a problem with it.

Of course, I always enjoy AOT, so my enjoyment rating is a 10. As someone who's read the manga (mostly because of people spoiling it since it's been out for a while), I can assure you that this season will have the most action. Yes, that's lowkey a spoil, but you could probably figure it out from foreshadowing. 

After all, the show is named after Eren's Titan... The Attack Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) :P",2020-12-29T14:19:00+00:00,10
"I am someone who has read the manga ahead, so this review is going to be based around the events that occured in the manga that will be included in this season. As a long time aot fan, I can say that this season will be game changing, not only for the aot fandom, but for every anime watcher. Without going into spoilers too deeply, I can say for sure there will be many changes to the characters we all once knew, as well as our perception as to who the 'real' enemy is. Truths that were burred away would be once more revealed inthis season, for the better or for worse. Betrayals of brothers, comrades and allies would occur. Action of a degree that we once didn't think was possible would become possible in this season. 

Although I would admit that this season is overhyped, I can't blame the fanbase, or the community for that. This is a season to truly look forward to.",2020-12-28T14:49:00+00:00,8
"This review does not have any spoilers for the upcoming manga portion, but as a manga reader myself, it has my opinions on the adaptation. Also, I’ll be updating this review after every episode to incorporate my views of the same.Note: the section-wise ratings are subject to change as the series progresses. '?' means I would add the score after it'd finished airing.Story (?/10):The section Season 4 Part 1 (assuming it lasts 16 episodes) covers isn't the strongest arc SnK has to offer, but is important and well-written in that it sets up for the final arc very nicely.We are shown the current situation inMarley – the decreasing military advantage of using Titans as the world starts developing anti-Titan weaponry. The oppression of Eldians continues, except for the families who are awarded the Honorary Marleyan status whose youngsters inherit one of the Titans currently in possession of Marley.
Reiner remains traumatized by his experiences within the walls. Gabi, his cousin, is the favourite candidate to inherit his Armoured Titan, while Falco wishes to inherit it so as to save Gabi from having her lifetime shortened to 13 more years.
With Titans no longer providing a secure future for Marley, and only a year left for Zeke to retain the Beast Titan, it becomes necessary to capture the Founder from Paradis. The Tybur family, possessors of the War Hammer Titan, have been called to Marley.

The Paradis characters from seasons 1-3 will appear some episodes into the series. How that will happen is a spoiler, but it is a major point in the story where the plot picks up pace. The focus will shift to Paradis Island itself later on, and the story only gets more exciting thereafter.

The pacing leaves nothing to complain about. Some minor important scenes have been removed, and several unnecessary ones shortened, but it conveys everything that should be, and hence isn’t a problem. Some sections have been reordered for better flowing episodes, and that’s totally fine.


Art &amp; Animation (9/10):

MAPPA does it well, the art and animation are both very good. It is a change from the previous seasons adapted by WIT, obviously, so here’s my views on these changes:

What MAPPA did better:
1.The characters’ facial expressions and designs are very detailed and their movements are much more fluid. The WIT designs were simplistic, not bad by any means, but the MAPPA versions suit SnK better.
2.The colour palette is much more suitable to the tone of the story, and sets up the atmosphere perfectly for this season.
3.The CGI is better in MAPPA’s adaptation. The Armoured Titan left nothing to complain about, and while the Beast looked kind of weird at times, it was still better than WIT’s Colossus from the Shiganshina arc.

What WIT did better:
1.The clarity was better in WIT’s adaptations, while MAPPA’s scenes feel foggy or blurry at times. One may argue that it suits the darker, murkier atmosphere of the Marley arc, but I believe that could’ve been done without compromising on clarity.
2.The direction, choice of points of view and camera angles was better with WIT. MAPPA doesn’t leave anything to complain about it, yes, but WIT had used it cleverly. The points of view and focuses changed with the changes in what the scenes were trying to portray, and added a fantastical feel to the world of SnK.

Overall, I’d say MAPPA is doing a wonderful job animating SnK – obviously with pros and cons when compared to WIT but overall is much more than satisfactory.


Music (10/10):

MAPPA really excelled in this department; the music is downright awesome. The opening seems weird at first but grows on you eventually, and perfectly fits the tone of what this season will be all about. The absence of scenes which hold potential spoilers is an added bonus. The ending itself is very beautiful as well, and you should read its lyrics.
The OST is wonderful as well. The score by itself is not that unique or epic, but the way it blends with the scenes and the atmosphere, and sets up for the events on-screen is totally beautiful. It manages to convey the right emotions in the right intensity for whatever scene it plays alongside.


Characters and Voice Acting (9/10):

When comparing character designs between MAPPA and WIT, the latter felt more moe/childish than what a story like SnK should allow, but they can’t be blamed since they re-designed the characters since Isayama’s (SnK manga author) artwork wasn’t that good back then. MAPPA’s realistic and detailed character designs are both closer to the manga as well as suitable to the raw, gritty, and dark atmosphere of the story.

Here’s my views on some of the major characters (in order of appearance):

Falco: Kind-hearted kid who doesn’t want Gabi to inherit the Armoured, or better, doesn’t want her to die 13 years later. He doesn’t believe that becoming an Honorary Marleyan in exchange for inheriting a Titan is a fair deal. His VA doesn’t leave anything to complain about either.

Gabi: Boar-headed, impish, and ambitious. She is the favourite for inheriting the Armoured Titan, and is prepared to wipe of the devils on Paradis Island. Her VA is perfect, and she definitely is the best adapted (new) character as of yet.

Reiner: The design for his 4-years-later version suits him very well, and he seems grown up and yet the same ol’ Reiner that we all know. Traumatized by his experiences on Paradis, he doubts whether the devils on Paradis Island were actually the devils he had been told they were or not. He doesn’t want Gabi to inherit the Armoured either. His voice actor has managed to convey this new phase of his life wonderfully, and we can almost hear in his voice all the emotions he is feeling and the dilemmas he is facing.

Zeke: His new character design seems shaggier (both human beard and monkey hair), and his VA is just as good as in the previous seasons. With 1 year left in his term, he is willing to plan an attack on Paradis to capture the Founder. His experiences with Levi still haunt him, though (obviously).

Eren: He appears a few episodes into the anime, and how he does that is a huge spoiler. I’ll suffice to say that his character design leaves nothing to complain about either, and his VA did a great job portraying the Eren of 4 years later, with all the changes that happened to him during that time.

The rest of the Paradis gang has yet to appear, but given the quality of the above mentioned character designs, and the fact that their Vas were pretty good during WIT’s adaptation, I have nothing to worry about.


Overall (?/10):

The adaptation more or less lives up to the expectations of both manga readers as well as the anime-only gang. I expect the animation to improve in the further episodes, and I hope the quality of art and OSTs is maintained. These first few episodes will be confusing and perhaps relatively slower-paced, but things are about to spike up soon. Keep watching, and start watching if you haven’t yet!",2020-12-27T22:04:00+00:00,9
"“Older men declare war. But it is youth that must fight and die.”― Herbert HooverAn opinion review from a fan of battle shounen genre and a big hater of Attack on Titan. The new season changed my opinion on the franchise overall, here is why. The following review will also contain some of the comments/articles, I found on the internet and I will try to find my own explanation of what Attack on Titan truly is. This, however, does not imply that my opinion is the only one that is right; there are many possible explanations and analyses of the story. Not Just a BattleShounen It is an open secret that Attack on Titan is aimed at an older audience than the big anime three.

Attack on Titan attracted a huge casual audience that began to watch the anime as the series peaked its popularity in 2014. And although the anime hype has subsided, it still has a huge number of loyal fans, who buy up every new game, or spin-off in the west. There was even an original comic book series and a Marvel crossover, where Spider-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Avengers fought Titans on the streets of New York. While the original manga is nearing completion, the end of the franchise is not yet to see. But as with any long manga, the closer you get to the ending, the more you understand the true meaning of the work and its message. 

Key Events 
Throughout the series' arcs, Eren was motivated by the two things: the first being, to kill every titan in order to avenge the death of his mother and the destroyed homeland, and the second being, to get to the mysterious basement in his house and use the key that his father gave him. Even in spite of all the difficulties and problems that accompanied him thought his journey, Eren Jaeger never refused to give up on these two things. In chapter 85, he finally made it to the basement, where he found a photo of his father with another family. From the diary of Grisha Jaeger, Eren and his companions learned that he really was from the outside world. And the fact that all humanity was destroyed by the titans, and the remnants of people hid behind the walls, turned out to be a huge fraud. Grisha, and everyone outside the walls, are of the Marley people, known as the Eldians. Long time ago, there were powerful people, who ruled the earth for almost 2,000 years. During that era, a woman named Ymir Fritz gained the power to transform into a titan. After her death, her soul was divided into 9 titans, who inherited the power of Ymir and staged terror. They began to conquer other peoples and created the Eldian Empire. Other races were treated inferior by the Eldians, oppressed and killed just for fun. Yet, the 145th King of Eldia, Karl Fritz, did not want to maintain this order of terror, and so he took most of the Eldians to the island of Pradise and with the help of the power of the Founding Titan, he erected three huge walls there. 

At this time, the people of Marley rebelled against Eldia, took the powers of almost all the titans and controlled the continent. As a result, everyone who remained on the mainland was either killed, or driven into a ghetto, and King Fritz, who created his city on Pradise Island, announced an ultimatum: if the Marlians try to attack the island, he will free hundreds of titans hidden inside the walls and attack the continent. All Eldians driven into the ghetto wear one-star armbands and are considered criminals for generations to come. Those Eldians breaking the law are taken to Paradise Island, where they are injected liquid that turns them into mad titans to ravage the local lands. Grisha Yeager was involved in a revolutionary movement to restore the monarchy of Eldia. He even married the King's heiress. They had a son, Zeke, but he betrayed them and surrendered their parents to the government of Marley. As a result, the entire movement was taken to the island and turned into titans. But Grisha was saved by one of the soldiers, who turned out to be the secret leader of their resistance. He gave Grisha the power of the Titan, and sent him to find the power of the very first Titan, so that with its help he would regain the control on the continent. The manga is now on its final chapters and things are getting very interesting. 

Allusion to Fascism 
The story changed from just telling about the good and the evil and about those who fight for a just cause to the story about the human’s nature, where there is no black and white, only ideologies and hatred. The situation with Eldia and Marley is very easy to compare with real historic events. The heroes we were rooting for turn out to be the descendants of the oppressors, eager to regain power in their land. So, heroes turn into villains. This is not the last season of Game of Thrones. Some people even believe that the anime contains anti-Chinese and especially anti-Korean nationalist ideas with a pro-Japanese subtext. Even more, some people see it as an allusion to the confrontation between Japan and Korea. First, in the anime and the manga there are two types of titans: there are these ugly, hyperbolic and weak-willed freaks with hypertrophied body parts. They are opposed by pure titans like Eren. And then there are the Eldians from the ghetto. Also in the anime, militarism is presented as the only answer to any issue that might arise. Second, the creator of the manga, Hajime Isayama, even admitted that General Dot Pixis was written off from the Japanese commander Akiyama Yoshifuru, who served the Japanese Empire and was considered a hero. He is responsible for the massacres in Korea during the Japanese occupation wars, including the assassination of the Korean Empress Myeongseong. At the same time, he is also responsible for the euphemism ""Comfort Women"" - this is how thousands of women, who were taken from Korea to Japan for sexual slavery were described. After this, a number of threats from Koreans began to appear on Ishiyama's twitter, who promised to kill him, burn him or beat him to death with a bat. By the way, China simply banned Attack of the Titans in the country. Many believe that Eren's idea of bloody revenge on the entire dirty world reflects the radical thoughts that the author of the story lobbies. People are Blind However, both the manga and the anime are coming to an end. What caused such a violent reaction, and the thought that Attack of the Titans is a right-wing radical work with almost fascist overtones? I do not know. For some completely unknown to me reason, no one found a term ‘Mudblood’ in Harry Potter weird and I can make many more examples. But this is not what this review is about, it is about what Attack on Titan truly is and it is mainly a story about a war and how wars change people, which the viewer can clearly see, when following Eren Yeager, as the story progresses.  I mean, the change is clear. Remember all the comments and the hate Eren got in the first seasons and now what he is. This is what becomes of people, who see war, who lose their nearest and dearests that will NEVER be returned. And this happens because of some senile man, who claims to have nightmares that the life in your country is not as good as they think and that they want to change it for the best. And you know what is really horrible? It is the understanding that soldiers are powerless and most of the time they are not protecting the sacred place, the homeland, but wage some completely unnecessary wars. 

All in all, where was I? I think, the message of Attack on Titan is clear, humans are the most stupid animal there is; there have always been wars and it will stay that way. One thing you are to respect Attack on Titan for, is that in manages to show all the horrors of wars. Do not try to find some pointless messages, it has nothing to do with fascism, it shows that you are to fight against pointless wars, which is the most poisonous sickness humanity is still completely unable to cure.",2021-11-24T11:15:00+00:00,9
"I was somewhat nervous for this anime going into it. Having just recently watched the last two seasons of Attack on Titan, I really enjoyed how Wit Studio handled the series with its amazing moments that stand out even to this day. However, besides some shortcomings with the animation which can be forgiven, Mappa did a fantastic job.First off, let's start with what's the worst part of this season and that's the animation and art direction. Now, people are definitely overexaggerating when they say that the CGI ruined the entire season for them. Personally, the CGI wasn't really that bad most of the time andin the first episode, it really blew me away with how amazing those 3D Titans looked. That being said, the animation at other times felt somewhat lackluster, especially during episode 6, 7, and 14. Now, it wasn't horrendous by any means but especially compared to the previous seasons, those highs weren't really there.

That being said, the animation issues weren't at fault of the animators. It's been very transparent that the time that was allotted for Mappa to complete this portion of the final season was not nearly enough time to make an amazing looking product. I mean, look at Jujutsu Kaisen. Given enough time, they are able to make something really incredible that redefines what we should expect from animation. Everything from faces looking slightly off from what they were like previously to CGI maybe not looking the best it could (mostly due to the movement) could all have been fixed if the studio had even just a week or two more to polish everything up. However, these issues don't overshadow what was truly amazing about the show, which is basically everything else.

Hiroyuki Sawano and Kohta Yamamoto are back again composing for this series with the latter taking up most of the heavy lifting with Sawano left to handle a few of the tracks played over the course of the season. As usual, the music is phenomenal with this season's music sounding very different from what we usually expect from Attack on Titan. I believe Yamamoto made this decision on purpose in order to help differentiate this season from those that came before as from a narrative perspective, it totally is. All I can say is that it worked and I can't wait to see what they do for the final portion of the story.

Now, the story and the character development that took place were a step above from what even previous Attack on Titan seasons had. Focusing on a brand-new cast of characters that we weren't familiar with was a great choice on Isayama to explore other aspects of the world. Mappa handled this story really well and I believe this is even better than the previous high that was Season 3 Part 2 with a ton of emotionally gripping scenes that had me on the edge of my seat. In particular, Episodes 3 and 15 were phenomenal as they were primarily flashback episodes that made us really empathize with those characters. Also, Episode 5 literally had me shaking with anxiety during the entire runtime. I literally can't think of any other time that I was so nervous for what was about to happen in a story. I can't express enough how this season really improved on what was a great base and delivered a gripping story about the consequences of war and racism by placing us into the minds of those characters directly impacted by them.

In conclusion, I cannot even think of giving this any less than a 10. While the animation was weak at times, it never detracted from my enjoyment of this story that was told so well with great voice acting, music, and gripping character development that made you rethink who's your favorite character. Right after this season ended, I couldn't wait any longer and jumped on the manga. All I can say is that everyone is in for a ride and I can't wait to see how Mappa handles the final portion of the story.",2021-10-27T18:48:00+00:00,10
The first part of the final season was a great addition. It summed up any questions I had about the story and it all made sense. It was as if it was all planned from the start its very impressive. I think it was very brave the way they handled Eren and his character development across the show was great. All the characters had motivations that made sense. The art work I believe improved a lot. I really like the new darker aesthetic it suits the show. My only problem with the show would be that there was way too much exposition and not enoughaction. The action was great whenever it was there but there was too much story telling but it did have its reason to be fair.,2021-10-11T02:45:00+00:00,9
Just got word that there is a new season of attack on titan coming out. so why the fuck is this called Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season. WHEN WILL IT END. AOT is only a good beginner's anime because it's not too long or not too short. the voice acting oh god don't get me started about the voice acting sub and dub its let's say one simple word it's shit. I think the characters have a good plot and the character development is amazing but the art and CGI. I don't this CGI belongs in anime but if u are going to putit in at least do it right. if ur starting anime and don't know what to start on I recommend full metal alchemist brotherhood. NOT THAT AWFUL FIRST ONE FULL METAL ALCHEMIST. watch brotherhood.,2021-10-07T14:22:00+00:00,7
"Since I watched Shingeki no Kyiojin's first episode I was instantly hooked by its simple yet brilliant premise. It is a tale filled with dense themes like humanity, social inequity, hope, among other uncomfortable stuff. These subjects have been deep and carefully handled from the start of the story, but they were also delegated as background context giving the Titans, and rightfully so, being the spotlight of the central conflict. The first act of the final season does things the other way around: the Titan conflict taking a backstep in favor of exploring and expanding upon its darker themes, and given the revelations that wereunveiled in the last episodes of the third season it makes sense that it shifted towards this direction. This new shift is, as many times in this story, a gamble, most of the time it pays off with flying colors, as it shows the maturity towards the darker themes and narrative of this season, however, sometimes this more lore-focused narrative overwhelms many of its players, as they too at times become background characters, even the main ones, this is not inherently a bad thing but sometimes it is a little hard to tag along, given that in past seasons they were undoubtedly the axis that guided the show.

As expected by having MAPPA studio or any other studio, all of its character design received a not so striking but surely notorious change, this is no complaint though, as one could only imagine the immense hard work that it represents to follow-up a piece of work with the magnitude of SNK, but I do think they did great. The most notable changes and maybe the more affected by this new change are the Titans, aside from some close-up shots they are mostly shown in CG fashion, unfortunately enough, Wit accustomed us to amazing Titan animation (mostly in 2D) but this season's Titan fights have pretty notorious and kinda stiff 3D animations, it is a little sad to say it but in most of the fights my immersion was broken at the beginning by this violent visual shift.

Getting 3D animation aside, everything else was handled excellently. From the first episode you're thrown at an unspecified place in time and place along with seemingly new or known characters, it has a huge element of confusion that builds up tension, and for the first half of the season, the tension will highly increase by each episode to conclude with a strong climax. After the second half, the story takes a more expository turn which downs the tension a few notches to slowly but surely set the ground for the next and final season.

One aspect that shines with the change of studio is the editing and scene transitions, SNK wasn’t a stranger when doing its serious scenes more dramatic, however, there is something special with this new direction that makes this kind of scenes more personal and at many times unnerving, many of this scenes have to do with Reiner and his constant internal struggles and make him incredibly relatable. 

Nitpicks aside, this first half of the final season was an exhilarating ride that make me have my teeth firmly clasped by each episode. The first half of this season was the strongest but that’s not to say the second is bad, as it has some of the highest peaks of the season. After the end of the last season, I was a little nervous about how things would unfold, but my fears were unfounded as once again SNK struck me with a tremendous punch of why it is one of my favorite shows, and I for one can’t wait to see how things will reach its final climax.",2021-10-03T10:44:00+00:00,9
"Attack on titan s4 was by far the best season without including s3 part2,the animation by mappa was astonishing and beautiful,the cgi was really good except the beast titan,this season was very dark and revealed a lot of surprises and answered a lot of questions ,my favourite episode was ep 5 ,the writing ,the osts was amazing and the voice acting was on point,i stated watching aot since 2017 and to see where it is at right now is so eye watering, this show will be my best show for ever and i dont think any anime will beat aot any time soon maybe 10years from now ,but its steal hard",2021-10-01T08:32:00+00:00,10
"Between the last season and this one - I have started and finished the manga, and this season follows it pretty closely. Although I do feel like it was actually pulled off better in the anime, I feel like a certain death in this series was not treated nearly as big as it should have been for the viewers - it was heavy and hard-hitting for the characters, but not enough for the audience - so I feel like that caused a bit of a downfall.There has definitely been a MASSIVE improvement in regards to the art style for this season - they really eitherupped the budget, had a really excited and energetic animation staff, or both.  This was genuinely astounding and gets me REALLY looking forward to the finale.


The previous seasons have much better music than this season - it was too subtle, whereas previously half of the series was the music - this season also kind of had the opening sounding a bit... weird, too.


Mikasa Ackermann - Mikasa does not get to use her 3DMG nearly as much as she should in this season.

Eren Jaeger - We do not talk about Season 4 Eren.

Armin Arlelt - You can really see how much Armin has grown as a character, whilst still keeping his strong ideals and being an all-around good person.",2021-09-25T13:08:00+00:00,8
"What the hell did I just watch!!!?This is one of a kind show that has soared the bar really high for an anime and deserves the praise that it gets and more people need to watch this masterpiece which will question your morals about life and will change your perspective.The best thing about this show is that there are no villains and heroes.I cried a little, but multiple times while watching this poignant show and this turned out to be my favourite anime.After watching Season 4 part 1 or the final season part 1 I am just overcome with all sorts of feelings from this.This season was the best, better than the previous seasons, in my opinion. 

Characters are so complex in this and that's why Reiner Braun is my favourite character in the show.

Can't talk enough of this show.",2021-09-23T06:26:00+00:00,9
"Attack on Titan. The masterpiece of the ages, the irrefutable sensation that changed the world, and its ""Final Season"". The final season is the culmination of several years of extremely witty planning, anticipation, and clever foreshadowing. Since the start of the season, the fans ran rabid about the poor CGI, animation, and, artwork. While I'm not a guy who pays much attention to art, I will admit that the art of the previous seasons was several-fold better than its current state. Mikasa is still drawn like a 14-year-old girl, and in certain scenes looks abysmally similar to a boy. Armin looks awkward and he magicallynow has a double-chin despite the rest of his body being as lean as usual, or even leaner.

Regardless of that major discrepancy, that doesn't affect the grandiose narrative that Attack on Titan's final season's first part has to offer. Starting off in a previously unshown world, the dystopian environment of Paradis Island carries over in a war-flooded nation, ""Marley"". Note that this is much different than the rest of the show, as it's imbued with political drama and crisis. The Eldians are hated by everyone for something that's not even their fault, and the only way that they can make up for it is by being exceptional in the military, only to gain the status of an ""honorary Marleyan"". This arc introduces some amazing characters, and unfortunately, we also lose some (no spoilers). The new characters and the character development of existing and previously unknown characters is my favourite part of this season.

Gabi is the annoying brat, similar to Eren in the first season, except she's way more dislikable, and she provides some very good reasons for that (again, no spoilers). If there was one character that I could fucking punch as hard as I can, it would undoubtedly be Gabi. But despite this, I have to admit that she's one of the best-written characters Attack on Titan has to offer. Initially believing that all Eldians were devils, despite being one (claiming to be a ""good Eldian""), she finally realizes that the only devils were their interpretations of each other. Gabi matures along with the show to make up for her irrevocable deeds and seeks to atone herself, which is praiseworthy in itself.

Floch, an actual pussy who transforms into an actual warrior. He literally survived a suicide attempt and came out with a new perspective on life, to exterminate the people who put him in that situation and killed his friends. He lives to give meaning to his survival, which is termed, ""Survivor's Guilt"". Floch adds another form of realism to the show.  Being traumatized by what the Beast Titan did to them, it's no wonder he is merciless when it comes to attacking the opposite side. He wants everyone on the other side to feel what he went through. Sure, he can be dislikable. He argues in favor of Erwin receiving the injection, and there's really no way to tell whether he was right or wrong.

Reiner. Reiner was the big brother of the 104th Cadet Corps. He was strong and dependable while suffering from a split personality, which is revealed later in the earlier seasons. Reiner's strong persona is merely an afterimage of what is going on inside his heart; he idolizes Marcel, his friend who sacrificed himself to save Reiner and Bertholdt. He empathizes with the Eldians inside the wall, and doesn't realize how good friends they've become until later on. Reiner was a blind warrior, a mere pawn on the chessboard, and he knows that, which is exactly why he breaks down towards the end. The only thing that keeps him going is the realization that he can't let Gabi go through the same fate as him. To me, Reiner never was that much of an antagonist, just a severely misled man who was born on the wrong side of the wall.

And finally, Eren Jaeger himself. The man transforms into a literal edgelord beyond redemption. After seeing what Eren saw and going through what he did, realizing that his entire life was a lie, anyone would've become the ""villain"" that he did and would've done much worse than what he did. Eren finally sees the real world and it is incredibly apparent that he's no longer the whiny prick who ostracizes himself from the rest and thinks he's special. Instead, he realizes that he's the scapegoat and intentionally hurts his friends to drive them away from him. In conclusion, Eren becomes a Chad and obtains unforeseen clairvoyance, and drives his friends away for some apparent reason.

Attack on Titan is the most mainstream anime of all time, and for good reason. Though I believe that the beginning of the end of the anime could've been illustrated far better by its preceding studio in charge, I have no grounds to violate the extremely intricate story and its amazing characters. In no way is this my favourite anime, as I'm not an enjoyer of dark and dystopian animes, but this is one of the best anime of all time, no matter how mainstream it is.",2021-09-16T05:05:00+00:00,8
"Attack on Titan is a cutting edge show-stopper. It's not simply a piece of fiction which has tossed quality significantly more than one season, it's likewise one of the not many anime to have broken into the standard, to such an extent that individuals who don't watch anime at all have encountered and cherished it. The rise of the main period of Attack on Titan drove the series' prominence to levels once in a while seen before in the medium. The huge delay before the arrival of season 2 was a significant explanation (alongside certain pacing issues with the manga at that point) for thewithering interest in the series at that point. When S2 circulated, Attack on Titan wasn't the worldwide wonder any longer. One Punch Man had thought outside the box along these lines to AoT S1 and turn into the new huge anime among casuals and non anime watchers. 

Then, at that point came Season 3, and the series was thundering back. The interest in the series had never been higher, and fans rushed back in huge numbers to have their inquiries replied. Many started seeing the initial two seasons in new light once the disclosures displayed the many-sided arranging and colossal foretelling that had gone right in front of them when they'd watched it first. For my purposes, Attack on Titan was consistently extraordinary. Never has an anime caused me to feel so sad on the off chance that I saw the world according to the point of view of the characters. The outright secret encompassing the titans for the vast majority of the principal season alongside shocking activity for battles, important OST for practically any scene and enthusiastic exchange conveyed by energetic voice entertainers made for a remarkable encounter. Season 2 and 3 acquire more disclosures, gradually unfurling the secrets of the world and the titans and moving the subjects of the series. Season 4 has another apparent shift - a lot more noteworthy than past ones - and it handles it easily. 

An adjustment of studios has regularly driven anime series to destroy. The previously mentioned OPM was one of its new enormous casualties, yet other famous series like Seven Deadly Sins have likewise experienced because of it and never recuperated. 

Luckily, MAPPA have taken care of the progress well. They haven't been great (to a greater degree toward that later), yet all things considered, they've worked really hard delivering another period of what is presumably the most famous anime of the last decade. 

The beginning of S4 may have left certain individuals pondering where the first cast went. There's not simply a difference in cast in the initial not many scenes, yet in addition a switch in viewpoints. We're done seeing things from the side of Paradis and the Scouts. All things being equal, we presently see it from the perspective on Marley's champions, who're preparing to acquire the titans from their archetypes once their time expires. Gabi and Falco need to acquire the protective layer however Reiner, for example the plot protected titan (Sorry, needed to utilize this once I saw it on Reddit) can't get a break. Somebody, award him his desire to bite the dust. 

Eren's development as a person is one of the features of Attack on Titan as a series. He wasn't generally a fan most loved on account of his rash nature, however as time went on, his point of view of the things around him changed, most perceptibly on different occasions all through season 3. Come season 4, his person goes through a change in perspective; quiet and thoughtful, yet heartless. As his adage goes, ""I will not quit pushing ahead until every one of my foes are annihilated."" He's much more far off, to every other person in the show as well as to the watchers. In contrast to past seasons, his considerations are a secret and the season plainly shows the split among him and the other old Scouts. 

The treatment of his development personally and a titan shifter is extraordinary, first and foremost in the manga and afterward in the anime. Yuki Kaji, the voice entertainer, upheld this outstanding development by surpassing assumptions on character conveyance. I particularly love the delightful way well he's progressed flawlessly alongside Eren as a person and nailed pretty much every line. There's not really a line Eren has spoken in season 4 that isn't very important to the story. 

Goodness Gabi! Where do I by any chance start? She should be the female corresponding to pre timeskip Eren, however aside from some center qualities like being difficult, she isn't actually that like him. Gabi despises the Eldians from Paradis just because other than that she might suspect they're demons and ought to languish over the violations of their progenitors. Eren was obstinate, headed into practically unwinnable fights without even batting an eye. Be that as it may, his motivations to despise the titans were supported. His mom was eaten before him by a titan, his home annihilated and heaps of his companions butchered by titans without a second thought. He battled for his opportunity, and mankind's. 

Gabi, then again, loathes Eldians without having seen any of them. She kills individuals for greatness, only for some futile commendation. Furthermore, without ruining anything, I'll likewise add that she's a wolf in sheep's clothing with her notable line that is become predominant in images presently ""Yet did you witness it?"". 

With all due respect, she's a twelve-year-old young lady who's been indoctrinated so it's difficult to not give her some opportunity to be vindicated. Yet, kid, is she irritating! She's really depicted significantly better toward the beginning of the Marley bend in the anime than in the manga, so I didn't hate her so much. She's neither an awful person nor an incredible one, yet she fills her need. 

Onto Falco, then, at that point. My charming, adorable kid, would you say you are certain you had a similar childhood as Gabi? He's her total inverse, ready to identify with his foes and a direct opposite for all of Gabi's ethics. He sees things from a more extensive point, regularly showing development far past his years. He probably won't be pretty much as normally gifted as Gabi however he's significantly more affable. From posting letters for harmed individuals to aiding his foes who evade him all things considered, this great kid has everything covered. He's one of the wonderful things in this brutal world. 

Pieck is the new waifu that each fan is by all accounts groveling over; Reiner and Zeke share the title of best person among the Marleyans for me. Their subtle conflicts and thought processes, some of which are just seen by watchers, make a critical difference to their external persona, and this holds particularly valid for Zeke. 

Jean stays the person who makes the watchers question their ethics since he questions his own and that is the thing that I love about him. He's another who's made considerable progress since the cadet days. 

Did you think I'd have failed to remember Floch? He might've been a forgettable side person who didn't have a particular plan before S3 P2 (Isayama has himself conceded so a lot), yet he's one of the stars of season 4, managing everything like the chad that he is. He's a radical and his activities are ruthless; now and again, maybe he's doing it to satiate his own sense of self and disdain towards those who've detained him and his race behind the dividers. However, notwithstanding this, he's perhaps the most engaging character post time skip. He's unusual, energetic and has the dauntlessness to pull off stunts that might've had your jaws loosen on the floor a greater number of times than one. What's more, who can forget the ""shh?"" King Floch has irrefutably engraved his name as an Attack on Titan legend. 

There are such countless incredible characters in Attack on Titan that the survey would be excessively long in the event that I discussed every one of them, so I'll stop here. 

The person plans in Season 4 see an unmistakable change, and that is not all to do with the timeskip or the adjustment of the studio. It's a combination of both. To any individual who's perused the prior sections of the Attack on Titan manga, its a well known fact that the craftsmanship toward the beginning was unremarkable. Mind Studio worked really hard of improving the person plans and the workmanship as a rule, particularly in S1. 

MAPPA then again have adhered nearer to the manga craftsmanship style for characters (aside from improving Armin when contrasted with the manga, their purposes behind which I'd prefer to know). So there's a slight change in the craftsmanship style since they're following Isayama's specialty much more intently. 

The liveliness of S4 has been the most discussed point, and all things considered. I'll mince no words: a portion of the CGI was tremendously horrible. There was some really great CGI like the Jaw titan, however some vital scenes including the Attack Titan and Beast Titan were repulsive. It's not the artists who're to be faulted for this but rather the voracity of the creation board of trustees and the manga distributers who needed to have S4 circulating before the finish of the manga to help deals. 

For practically some other anime, I would've let even the awful CGI scenes slide, yet this is Attack on Titan, one of the most well known and profoundly acclaimed anime ever, and definitely it merited the most ideal treatment. Tragically, it didn't get that. Does it make the season terrible? Obviously not since the season covers probably the best bend in the manga and the actual transformation was devoted with top level voice acting. Could better activity lift S4 of Attack on Titan to more elevated levels? Incredibly. 

The CGI wasn't generally as awful, yet had sufficient predominance in the main minutes (Eg: Attack Titan versus Warhammer Titan) to be a stain on a generally heavenly season. 

We have some new and really amazing tracks added to the all around extraordinary OST from S1 - S3. One of the features in the sound organization this season is that there were various authors relying upon whose point of view a scene is displayed from. For Paradis, we have Hiroyuki Sawano back with every one of our top picks from past seasons while Kohta Yamomoto took care of the Marleyan side, giving us bangers remembering Ashes for the Fire. I missed the old OST in the initial not many scenes since I was stressed they'd underuse S1-S3 OST, however they didn't. It wasn't utilized much in light of the fact that the underlying scenes happen according to the viewpoint of the Marleyans. Truly, having various writers for one or the other side of the contention appears to be a great decision and helps drenching.",2021-09-14T08:41:00+00:00,10
"Well before the last season of shingeki and the truth is very good to see the genius of eren do his thing. The truth is very very good, unexpected things are revealed to us and they leave us wanting to know what is going to happen. Team was tough that kills everyone. death and destruction is always welcome. I hope they soon release the last season of the anime. We see how the new animation studio does what it can with the series and the truth is it handles it quite well. Taking that out leaves us wanting to continue the series and see whatit holds for us. I still don't understand how they didn't cheer her up all at once and without complications last season.

En español:
Bueno ante ultima temporada de shingeki y la verdad muy bueno ver al genio de eren hacer de las suyas. La verdad muy muy bueno, se nos revelan cosas inesperadas y nos dejan queriendo saber que va a pasar. Equipo eren duro que mate a todos. la muerte y destrucción siempre es bien recibida. Espero que no tarden en sacar la ultima temporada del anime. La espero con muchas ansias. Al parecer me tiraron esta reseña porque la versión en ingles era muy corta. Que lindo tener el poder de sacar cosas de la pagina. Si algún moderador lee esto saludos. Me gusto porque dentro de todo la animación sigue siendo buena, maneja bien los tiempos y vemos mucho como crece Eren como un antagonista. Espero que esto sea suficiente para que te quedes a gusto con lo que escribo saludos y váyanse a la mierda. No me baneen por favor. Vemos como el nuevo estudio de animacion hace lo que puede con la serie y la verdad lo lleva bastante bien. Sacando eso nos deja con unas ganas de continuar la serie y ver que nos depara. Todavia no entiendo como no la animaron todo de una y sin complicaciones la ultima temporada.",2021-08-14T16:26:00+00:00,9
"This is hands down the most relevant anime out now. Attack On Titan season 4 has everybody talking. It's like the Avengers Endgame of the anime community. I think it's pretty obvious that when Isayama wrote Attack On Titan, he wanted to spark a conversation, to flip the idea of war and justice on its head and see how the audience reacts. There are a ton of anime that are deep or intellectually stimulating but AOT is special. Attack On Titan isn't just thoroughly entertaining, it's a story that challenges its viewers to think more deeply about things, like morality and freedom. In such anentertainment based cosumer society, its rare that a piece of fiction we consume will actually make us question ourselves. 

For me, the greatest thing any anime or piece of fiction can do is change my thinking. But Attack On Titan isn't niche. It has a ton of people thinking differently and that's what makes it not just good, but amazing. It's a real bummer the fan base is so ass.",2021-08-12T12:59:00+00:00,10
"Out of all the seasons, I'd have to say the writers must have had a hard time thinking of ways to implement the plot in it.  The first 4 episodes were insanely boring because we were introduced to ""hateable"" characters and their annoying backstories with their excuses for ideals and goals for saving the Eldians by becoming ""good Eldians"".  I have not read the manga so I don't know if they have any ulterior motives but as far as we know, we can tell that that's all there is to it.  I was also very confused with the time skips from thebeginning.  I couldn't tell if what was happening was in the present or in the past until a character showed up that made it easier to tell.  There was never any specific dating for when events were occurring. We would go from the present to some time in the past to a time even further into the past and then back to the present.  After a while I got used to it and could tell but at the beginning it was super confusing.

Later on in the season, more active scenes happen and plot development builds with the action.  The plot is good in a way that even the smallest occurrence can cause a huge impact in the behaviour and attitudes of the characters. (SBD for those who watched it lol) A very disappointing thing happened in the show that made me want to stop watching but I continued because I want to see what happens next so this season was good in a way that it made me want to continue watching it. Basically, other than the new characters being introduced and extremely long dialogues with little action that ""actually mattered"" at the beginning + the confusing time skips, the story is not bad considering the huge plot twists that happen in the story.  I also appreciate the character development that happened to our MCs like Armin, Mikasa, and Eren.  I have also come to like some of the new characters (with many exceptions) and the way they were put into the plot. This was a good season but not as good as the others were, imo.",2021-07-21T08:47:00+00:00,9
"Attack on Titan has been one of the best things out there for years consistently, period. Season 4 continues that trend and then some. The only difference this time is a change in studio, from WIT to MAPPA, and for all the vitriol fanboys threw at the new studio, I have to say, none of it was warranted (fuck those toxic fans). MAPPA legit did an amazing job. They might not have been AS good as WIT on an overall basis but the difference is very minute. The 3D titans worked perfectly well for me 99% of the time. Very occasionally would they felt oddor off-putting. 

The genius writing of Isayama shines supreme here. All the work pays off in such a glorious fashion that it's hard not to be impressed time and time and time again. The way perspective shifts and you're left hanging in the middle only for things to escalate in the HYPEST of ways turns your insides to shreds and you're left cursing and praising this amazing story at a constant rate. 

Some amazing new music tracks although I wish they used old ones more too. The pacing does stumble a bit after the first 8 episodes or so but not to any strong degree. And the cliffhanger is just too cruel to leave us hanging on. Y U DO DIS AOT! 

Can't really say much more since this is the type of story where any slight hint can ruin it, so manga readers, don't comment. Anyone who hasn't started this anime yet, JUST DO IT! And to anyone who hasn't watched Season 4 yet, JUST DO IT! It's fucking amazing. And if I were to rate the first half of the final season, I'd give it a 9.5/10. 

P.S Eren... Oooof.",2021-07-16T11:13:00+00:00,9
"This review contains SPOILERS from the 4 seasons of Shingeki no Kyojin, don't read if you haven't watched (or read if you don't mind)Honestly, this was the worst season of Shingeki no Kyojin by far, this new season took everything that was good in the other 3 seasons putting only one boring fight and to show my point I will compare this season with the other seasons.This season didn't have the horror of when the titans invaded the wall, nor the kind of mystery when Eren turns into a titan like in Season 1.There wasn't the same mystery of how the Bestial Titan communicated withother titans and even people or how there were titans in a place with no signs of war, there was no plot twist like Bertholdt and Reiner turning into a titan and there were no moments memorable like the first time Eren uses the coordinates in season 2.

There wasn't an incredible moment like the part that shows how Eren gained the powers of a titan, the fight that took place DOESN'T CLOSE to the level of Levi vs. Bestial, I know Sasha's death was sad, but it's nothing compared to Erwin's death and not to mention other things that get better in Season 3.

In this 4th season, the only thing that would stand out would be the fight between Eren vs Titan Hammer, but this fight didn't even come close to the level of Levi vs. Bestial, Eren vs. Reiner or Annie vs. Eren.

And I know that the mysteries I mentioned had already been solved in the other seasons, but that's exactly why I think this season was bad, it didn't feel the same as the other seasons did and I didn't see any reason to be considered a great season let alone reach the top 2 with only 1 confused episode.

I don't speak English so if the text was confused, sorry",2021-07-11T15:29:00+00:00,3
"""Humanity will continue to wage war until there is one human or less""                               - Erwin SmithAnimation - 9.9/10The animation is astounding. The fight scenes are very dynamic and the ODM gear sequences can be mesmerizing as hell. There are a few CGI shots, but those are very easy to miss and i certainly wouldnt have noticed had they not been pointed out to me.Soundtrack - 10/10There are few anime that can match AoT's masterful soundtrack.Composed by the legendary Hiroyuki Sawano, the soundtrack adds further impact to the already hard-hitting plot of this show and helps craft some of the most iconic scenes in all of anime.

Voice Acting - 10/10
There aint much to say here. The VAs of this show are very talented and have been very successful in fleshing out the emotions, complexity and contradictions of the characters.

Characters - 10/10
The characters in this show are very realistic and well written and have a great deal of complexity and depth.
Nonetheless, a lot of people seem to miss this one but let me explain. In a lot of shows, the development of characters is laid bare before the watchers and is largely explicit. This is not the case with AoT, which often leads casual or non-attentive watchers to assume that the characters lack depth or real development. A lot of the characters have enjoyable and explosive moments and development, sure, but much of the development and characterization in this show is very implicit. A character does not need to give a giant monologue about being heartbroken, A simple gesture towards the object of one's childhood dream accompanied with a shot of the character's hollow and depressed visage. An expression of utmost horror on the face of a fearless and admired leader. A face of cold grief as one encounters the the oblivious parent of a dead comrade. The wistful last moments of a seemingly hardened and unemotional soldier, as he reminisces about the girl he loved but never paid any attention to. All these are but a few examples of AoT's masterful visual storytelling that convey the emotions, contradictions and hypocrisies of our characters, while leaving a great deal up to our interpretation and imagination. Characters in this show, irrespective of whether they are the ""good guys"" or the ""bad guys"", have compelling motivations and convictions that (intelligent) viewers can understand or relate to. Even when they operate in morally gray areas or commit reprehensible activities, you may find yourself sympathizing with and pitying them. Few shows can make compelling heroes and villains, and fewer still manage to craft rich narratives where there are simply no heroes or villains - just humans, enslaved to and driven by their beliefs and circumstances. Attack On Titan is unquestionably one of the latter.

Plot - 10/10
Out of the hundreds of anime, novels, manga and movies I have seen, only a handful of stuff matches (or surpasses) the level of storytelling Attack On Titan has to offer. Its a grandiose story that starts in a harsh medieval looking dystopian world and ends in an equally unforgiving world of warships, trenches, artillery and zeppelins. And in between, the development it undergoes is something I have hardly experienced in any other work of fiction. We start with a story where we and the characters know nearly nothing and as the plot progresses, we find ourselves in a different dilemma. Knowing so much that we can no longer discern truth from lies. There is no question as to why this story is so popular. After all, it isnt just a single story. It is political thriller, a coming of age story, an allegory of war and finally, a critique of humanity itself. This is the story of the brother who wanted to avenge his sister, of the child who desired salvation, of the man who coveted truth, of the lover who craved happiness for her beloved, and of course, it is the story of Eren Jaeger, the boy who sought freedom. It is all this and much more. This is Attack On Titan, the story that will leave you with more questions than answers, with one of
the foremost being:

WHO IS THE REAL ENEMY?",2021-06-26T05:28:00+00:00,10
"I honestly haven't expected last season to be this much of a garbage. But it did. This is first review I will do with spoilers included, becuase its impossible otherwise to explain things from my power of view. First of all, like third season, this one starts with something completely unrelated to previous one, something that has never been mentioned before. So you kinda feel lost even if you watched carefully previous season. Four full episodes are just things happening before season one, and to be honest, stuff like this is reason what made me puke on Attack on Titan the most in previous seasons.There are just so many episodes, FULL EPISODES, spent about past memories, or should I say, past things that happened prior to season 1. Sure, some things from the past should appear here and then to keep up with specific events, but having this many episodes (and again), FULL EPISODES where ""plot twists"" happen because of things you don't know happened, but they did, and then you have to watch those episodes which are basically ""prequel"" to the main story... Its so exhausting. And its not even a plot twist if it happened before.

Now back to season 4, even tho things mentioned above means for it as well. Gabi? KILL HER FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! Most annoying brat ever. Scouts have killed so many, even less dangerous enemies by far, but for the sake of the plot, lets keep Gabi alive who is obviously a psycho and doesn't deserve to live. Why? Just for the sake of plot and drama later on. And well, Sasha's death as well, because why not. Then you have all of those enemy titans who got destroyed, but not killed. Why? Because for the plot! Why would you kill someone who wants to kill you, when you can keep them alive and let them (eventually) kill you later. Its that simple. Such a BS!

Honestly, I even forgot who was Sasha, due to her being known only by eating tons of food (which you get to see in few ""flashback"" episodes once again). And then they go. It feels like even writter figured out that everyone forgot who Sasha is, so they added those 2 episodes, full of flashbacks and past memories where focus is fully and entirelly on no one else, but Sasha. I guess attempting to awoke some emotions inside us for us. For me, it didn't happened.

From story side, I think 4th season have more events than all 3 previous seasons combined. And its moving on so fast, you can't keep track with anything. And then again, flashbacks. One episode of current event going on is followed up with at least 2, maybe even 3 episodes of events prior to season 1. And whole season is like that.

In general, I love plot twists, but amount of ""plot twists"" here is insane, to the point that you can't even call it a plot twist, since you will already get used that someone will backstab someone else. Eren still managed to be my number 1 worst main character ever, even tho his character development is way too different than in any season before, but still - he suck.

Season in general wasn't terrible, but comparing to anything else seen from Attack on Titan, it definitely is the weakest part. Season 2 is kinda same, where I got a feeling that I am watching ""filler"" season, but for ""final"" season, I kinda had my hopes up. Well, had. Not anymore. At this point, I don't care if anyone dies, I lost sympathies for any single character. Except Levi. He is the only one whose personality I liked ever since the anime started.

Probably highlight of the final season is fight at that enemy territory, which name I already forgot since I didn't want to bother learning all the terms and stuff they used in this season to describe current, past and future events. After that, I hyped the season so much and couldn't wait to see what will happen next, but instead, AoT lose its pace and turns into complete boredom.",2021-06-21T09:53:00+00:00,6
"I found the final season to be a let down. Overall, the entire series has been great... certainly a classic. That's universally accepted, and it's quite an achievement. Well deserved, bravo.But I think that anyone giving this season a 10 is maybe engaging in nostalgia and being emotionally caught up in it being over (Well, except that it isn't over, which is also a point of contention).For me, a 7/10 is a good score for any anime series, but given the high quality of Shingeki  seasons 1-3, Final Season was a bit of a step backwards.Just a few notes...*At times, the art was... terrible.I normally don't care so much about that, but it was distracting here and there. Given the fame of the series, I expected everything to be top notch. I hear that Mappa had time issues, but is that really an excuse? No.
*The songs were... meh.
*Sound effects and acting were fine.
*Some episodes were didn't engage me and were largely boring. It's not just that they were lacking action. There were also lacking motivation and pacing, and the characters were not keeping me interested. The first time I felt this, I was shocked. Then it happened again.
*And about halfway through the series it was obvious that content from the manga was going to have to be trimmed away to finish the season. And so now we have ""Final Season... Almost"". I usually enjoy both manga and anime and don't pick sides... but the manga was clearly superior.

There are other things, but the gist is that this was a disappointing season for me. Hopefully the final final will be more satisfying.",2021-06-02T10:48:00+00:00,7

How did Titan exist in this world. How humans use Titan's power to start wars and attack other countries.Eren, who initially hates Titan, for killing his mother, and destroying his place of residence.Now Eren uses Titan's powers to save his people, his friends, and his hometown.An interesting story and difficult topredict, but that's what makes this anime interesting to watch.",2021-05-18T09:45:00+00:00,9
"To be honest, this season surprised me and disappointed me. I was without any expectations due to the new studio, director and the lack of a trailer with scenes ready for the episodes.ART:The animation was what surprised me the most, I thought the new studio would not be able to deliver good animations, but so far the design is consistent and even if the titas are in 3D, the 3D is not bad and 2D is very good when required.STORY:The story, as always, continues to surprise us with several plot twists. (I wasn't surprised when saw the anime because I read the manga)SOUND:My biggest disappointmentwas the soundtrack, it is the same as the previous seasons, but with some new tracks made by KOHTA YAMAMOTO, not SAWANO. The attack on titan soundtrack has always been perfect and very well used, but the new director is unable to use exciting tracks when it really needs, differently from previous seasons (examples: Eren closes the hole in the wall in trost; when Reiner and Bertolt reveal themselves to be Armor Titan and Colossal Titan). In conclusion, it is not bad at all, but it is worse than previous seasons.

OVERRALL:
I'm enjoying the FINAL SEASON less than other seasons, but it's still good",2021-04-27T19:40:00+00:00,9
"Look, I love this manga, and in turn, I love the anime.  The voice actors are great, the animation (used to be) is great, everything usually is amazing.And I know just how much of a time crunch MAPPA animators were in, but this is unacceptable animation to be completely honest.  I don’t blame the animators, but I do blame the executives for making this anime so quick.The story is still great, I still enjoy the storytelling so much, but the animation really made me not enjoy this until Eren punched the warhammer.  That was 5 episodes in.  That isn’t good.If youenjoy Attack on Titan and want to find out the rest of the story, this anime is great.  But don’t expect fight sequences to be anything special",2021-04-27T08:27:00+00:00,7
"I usually don't review separate seasons for what they are in anime, but the difference in quality of SNK in between each season is so different that it warrants me to rate this season by itself.*major spoilers aheadLet me go over the past three seasons very quickly first, because it still relates to this final one right here. First of all, let me just say that in the first season, I thought it was quite overhyped, but looking back, well, it's pretty good. Does it warrant all the hype? Yeah, I still don't think so, but the first season was still really good. I reallyliked how the plot was the only unique  shounen setting I've seen in awhile. Titans invading a walled off location? 3D maneuver gear? I like the style of the clothes of the regiments, I like the combat style, and the characters aren't just generic archetypes. You're exposed to every one of Eren's scout regiment team nicely. Overall, a good setting with a generic story and a set of good characters and action. A nice foundation for the following seasons. Seasons 2? Yeah, it was pretty bad. Plot holes are quite evident and some events don't make sense. Random characters that get introduced are suddenly influencing the story in a major way. Season 3 on the other hand, manages to get a lot of exposition and backstory done, along with some decent action in a decent manner. 
Season 4 is the culmination of all the exposition in season 3, the forced plot events in season 2, and the foundation of season 1. And overall, it makes sense, and more importantly, it's tantalizing! I want to know what happens next? What kind of shounen makes you believe it has a good overarching story? Literally, none. Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, One Piece, Jujustu Kaisen? You're kidding me. At the very least, even if you hate this show, you have to admit that the show attempts to create an interesting story that culminates into a climax. Something
that other shounens, even the good ones, don't do. Attack on Titan uses all of the plot arcs previously as a basis to create a finale which I appreciate. So much time has passed and major plot events happen, but overall, you're able to make a lot of sense of the evolution of Paradis Island (s2 is still shoddy). You get exposed to a lot of information that changes the plot dramatically. The story starts off as one about survival, and slowly evolves to one that's about securing one's interests, revenge, and war with other humans. Titans become obsolete and Paradis is able to eliminate all of them safely. New weapons get developed and are making even the 9 chosen titans less and less impactful on the military stage. The plot is bold, and Season 4 is the climax to all of the exposition and foundation that was laid out previously.
Just, the pacing in Season 4 is impeccable and the way information is presented to you in the beginning of the season is just amazing. The first 6-8 or so episodes were quite perfect. Braun's past. Gabi and the warrior candidates' introduction into story and the way they are a complete opposite to Eren and his company. The fact that there is so much time spent on Braun and the way they humanized him after understanding that he committed so many crimes he committed only highlights the hypocrisy, the crimes that he can't hide from Eren. Him and his relationship with his warrior candidates really make it that much more impactful when he finally meets with Eren and the powder keg has exploded. It's the little things that make a story good. Just simple message that Berthold had conveyed to him about wanting to be judged was an effective way of conveying Braun's psyche and his guilt. The tension, the buildup, and the final transformation that we were all expecting from Eren finally happens after all of that slow buildup. Truly, very good story telling.
This show also tackles something that other shounen shows ever so avoid is morality. Shounen's always get away with ""kill the bad guy."" Attack on Titan started off the same. There's a clear enemy: the Titans, and you need to show no mercy in order to survive. However, this show attempts to actually tackle the idea that well, there is no right side of history. That the victors of a war say that they're the good guys, while the losers were the bad guys. That perhaps, the enemy is no different than what they were. Is it a unique message? Absolutely not. No. But, I really just cannot stand how other shounen's do not confront this idea, and instead focus on how they gotta kill the baddies. We're the good guys, and they're the bad guys. The worst part is how the MC's in these Shounen's always got a rock solid justification for killings people. Yet, from another perspective, he might not be. Despite killing other people, the narrative is painted to the viewer that he's a good guy.
Another thing that pisses me off about generic shounens that Attack on Titan does not fall into is the characters and their backstories. Too many times have I watched shows where I look at their backstory 3 seconds after I get to know the character. Let me ask you: why the hell do I care about the backstory of some random person. Why bother? While I initially thought it was kind of weird, exposing Braun's backstory to the viewer so late into the game, it makes a lot of sense. And he's not just some random person. You see him develop, change, and unveil the mystery surrounding him in the last three seasons. Of course I want to know how he came to the decision of destroying the wall. Compare this to something like Demon Slayer, which gives the backstory of every other random demon that I don't give a rat's ass about. Backstories are meant to be given not to artificially accelerate as viewer's understanding of a character's motivations, personalities, and goals, but rather as a means of building off an already solid character. Otherwise, it's just a plot device to accelerate plot and skip characterization. 
Well, I'm spitting out praise for the first half of the story. What about the second half. I don't think it's bad by any means, but man, Gabi. I get that she's a foil to Eren, but damn did I want her to die. Plus, while she's not a completely random character inserted to the story, she is not given enough development for me to actually think she's a good character. Plus, she's just being put through the motions of many events that are being forced upon her. She goes through so many stages of development in a short amount of time. Again, I don't think she's a terrible character, but it's quite obvious what the story want her role to be. She needed to serve as someone who was brainwashed to kill Eldians, but then realizes that things are a bit more complicated. A complete opposite situation to Eren, obviously. Of course I'm going to like Eren more, by virtue of how much time I get to see him develop as opposed to Gabi's ""lightning course.""
I also can't say I like the second half of the plot nearly as much as the first half. The first half is perfect, but it goes a bit off the rails and the magic starts disappearing.  The fights are almost all CGI'd and it looks really bad. I wonder what would have happened if Ufotable was on the steering wheel instead. 

The second half of the story is, well, still good. You could say that the second half of the story is purely buildup for the next climax of the story, and again, I don't know the ending yet, so we'll just have to wait and see. There's a lot of information and plot events that happen with minimal explanation of them, but it sure breeds a lot of mystery and makes you want to know what happens next. It still maintains a good storytelling pace and lets you understand what's going on. There are a lot of different events with different characters at different locations, but you're never confused as to what's happening, and you're just wonder what's going to happen next. The integrity of the plot still gets maintained despite all the action that happens. I just really am curious as to whether or not Eren is faking it or not. We'll see!",2021-04-22T23:27:00+00:00,9
"This is my second favorite season of AOT series.The character development is so mind blowing,the story is one of the best,the music is still great and the animation is still goodLiterally one of the best anime I have ever watch,I have no problem with CG my only ""nitpicking"" is the color grading and some scene is so dark or blurry and in the ep 2 some character doing some weird movement like Udo talking scene,and I learned later that they are using rotoscoping because of the bad scheduledThe animation and the art style is not for me so i prefer the wit although the storyalone is great and I know mappa has a bad schedule for this season so I appreciate their work.

Overall I do enjoy the season but tbh if aot mappa a better schedule it could be better

I heard that the manga is ended so I hope mappa deliver us a great animation for the ending",2021-04-22T02:21:00+00:00,10
"I think mappa has done AOT well, like many cool scenes from season 4. But unfortunately, I lost the feeling of watching season 1 to season 3. It's really different watching season 4, like it's not the old AOT. But it doesn't matter as long as the story goes well because there is a time skip so the characters change. Eren, Mikasa, Armin are all adults now. So it really feels different to watch it, but interestingly there are more jokes here than the previous season. It's a bit funny to see a different titan change but it still tastes the same. Sometimes the animationsomehow seems like lagging, but maybe it's just my feeling. And indeed the end is very hanging, it was just about to start a fight but it stopped. Hopefully part 2 can be better according to our expectations.",2021-04-20T06:20:00+00:00,10
"I don't know what people are smoking on, but HOLY FUCK this is amazing of a season.Here's the thing. Yes, the adaptation is not as good as WIT's. The hellish schedule didn't allow them time to animate everything in 2D, but people have to understand that even WIT couldn't have done it. No studio could have pulled that off. MAPPA did a wonderful job under the time constraint. The CGI is prolly the best CGI I've ever seen in anime. However, we should NOT rate an anime simply as an adaptation of the original source. Otherwise, why do we even have a rubric with ""story""and ""character"" anymore? If all we care about is adaptation, as in how much the animation elevates the original material, then just give Demon Slayer a 10/10, will you? The adaptation carried so hard that even a lackluster story became a sensation. 

Even adaptation wise, this season is great. It is not amazing, but it is great. The animation is, for the most part, very good, even if we do not have the sakuga moments that we did in previous seasons. The art suffered from some inconsistencies, but again, it is primarily great. I personally find MAPPA's art better than WIT's because the characters don't look typical and it resembles Isayama's original art more, but that's my preference.

WIth regards to the plot and character, I don't think there's anything to be said anymore. It is GOAT. Everything about it is pure perfection, from the plot development to the character evolution. And with a perfect plot and a highly competent adaptation, I don't think we have the rights to nitpick and give it anything less than a 7.",2021-04-15T18:02:00+00:00,10
"My opinion is that this season is the best one we've seen so far in AoT and in general.We learn everything in this one. The direction of the story's conclusion is very smart by my perspective even though many didn't like it. They show both sides but from both perspectives and not only from the protagonist's, which makes the whole story way more interesting, sympathetic and dramatic.Same goes for the characters. I personally enjoyed it incredibly much.That said, there is one thing I didn't like as much as the previous seasons. That being the animation. Sometimes feels really awkward in some certain scenes, mostly inaction ones.",2021-04-15T17:11:00+00:00,10
"And thus, we hold our breaths, for everything hinges on the FINAL SEASON - part 2. xDMyes, so, the show isn't over yet! :D Whether or not this will go down in history, I think, will depend on the final season (or movie or whatever) coming out winter 2021 allegedly (mark my words, it's going to be delayed hehe). It certainly has the potential, but oh boy, is the landing going to be important!The pacing sure is very different from what we're used to. The animation I think, is still amazing - maybe not as hype as the previous season, but still very good.The musicas well, while perhaps not my style, is well composed and thought-true and fits the series well.

The story is kinda starting to lose me a bit. There's a time skip, a flashback, a bunch of people teaming up and backstabbing each other. It's interesting and has potential for sure, but I'm waiting with great anticipation for answers.

Because yes, somehow this show manages to still invoke many questions and mysteries even in its 4th season! Is this really shounen anymore? :')

The characters is the weakest point for me. Eren is back to being super edgy, Mikasa &amp; Erwin are the same, we get a very hateful girl. Mainly, I don't understand why people don't talk a bit more. Eren's plan is honestly not so bad, and he probably could have gone about it without doing all this crazy nonsense by just informing people and working together.

Zeke's thing is weird. I like his backstory. I'm just confused as to why Eren believes him so readily. I hope that gets explained a bit more.

The Ackerman reveal as well; I mean, I guess there is titans and all, but there is some sudden wonky stuff, even if it makes some things retroactively make sense.

I'm probably just too simple-minded for all of this. xD But bottomline, I enjoyed it, and you probably will too! I mean, if you got this far, you're not gonna stop, and you shouldn't! :D",2021-04-15T03:38:00+00:00,8
"The animation and story plot amazes me as a anime-only AOT fans. Many said Mappa weren't doing a great job in the animation this final season, but it sure make the whole anime looks more cold and realistic. Mappa is the more suitable animator to the theme and story of the season 4, you can't deny it. With that being said, Attack on Titan will sure bring more surprises and improvement in terms of the animation, for example, Eren's joining the Yaegerist in the sunset is not as good as it looks as in the official s4 trailer, however, that's still acceptable. If you thinkabout it, no anime's story, plot, character development, has ever come close to AOT. It is truly the anime that defines our generation. #ThankyouIsayama",2021-04-10T00:13:00+00:00,10
"This season was amazing. Attack on Titan never fails me. A lot of you guys talked about this season is horrible bla bla bla, but personally i feel this season is better than the previous season. the reason is the writing and story so far. If you think season 3 part 2 was the pinacle of AoT then this season and part 2 will become the monsters of anime. I always amazed with basement reveal and because of that we know the other side of wall is happening right now. thanks  to brilliat writinng and story. I think this season is delivered the hype.yes for part 2 its better if they use 2d titans.",2021-04-05T18:33:00+00:00,10
"(First of all, let me state that I assume that you, yes you, who is currently reading my text, knows what happened in this season. If this isn’t the case, then beware of spoilers!) *THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS*You know, there was a special anime once. No, a really special one. At first I actually didn't like it at all, and I also found it quite confusing and uninteresting. A “run of the mill shonen”, isn’t that what they call it? At least I thought that it was something exactly like that. But the longer it went on, the better it got, and with acertain second part of a third season it reached its absolute climax. It was so good that this anime almost had legendary status for me. And then I sat there, shocked and eagerly waiting for each new episode, watching one twist chasing the next and seeing how it became greater with every single episode. But of course even that season had to end once, too, and I couldn't wait to find out how the story would go on. 

Then I heard it: A final season was announced. I could hardly believe my luck, finally the time had come. But the first trailer unsettled me; was that still the anime I knew from back then? The first episode aired, and I watched it with doubts but also with great anticipation. And shall I tell you something? I was disappointed. My god this use of CGI, how could they do that? My beloved anime was destroyed by a single studio! Other people thought the same as I did, and a wave of hatred spread across the internet. And even though I single-handedly wanted to set the studio on fire, I kept watching. What choice did I have, after all? Week after week I waited. I waited for it to finally end so that I could find my redemption. It may sound like an exaggeration, but I've literally given up and lost faith that this show could still be saved in any way. 

But then I noticed it: My own stupidity. Judging an anime only by animation? Complaining about glimpses of unsightly scenes? Yes, of course it's true, using CGI that often wasn’t the nicest thing to look at. However, to think that this can completely destroy an anime is not true. My feelings were deceiving me, and so, to pay respect to the anime I loved so much, I decided to watch that season again from the beginning. And oh boy, there’s a lot we got to talk about. 

And yes, you guessed it right (which probably wasn't that difficult), I'm talking about the one and only: “Attack on Titan: The Final Season”.

To start things off, and furthermore to find a good introduction to the topic, let's talk simply about the aforementioned first episode. The episode that I thought was so bad, awful, terrible and whatnot. But in truth, it offered us, the audience, everything we could’ve asked for. Nothing big happens in terms of the story, but it’s characterized by the facts that 1. we get a look at the other side of the world for the first time, and 2., old characters return and new ones are introduced. Falco and Gabi, those who play the biggest role of those new characters in the later course, are perfectly represented by their words and deeds in that episode. 

Gabi, a girl who, driven by her hatred, wants to wipe out all people (especially our Eldia devils) just to make her family proud and to free her people from oppression. She doesn’t think about situations herself, but strictly obeys her orders. Without weighing what might be right or wrong, she simply believes what she was told from an early age. The will to inherit the Colossal Titan from her brother is made increasingly clear by her, and shows how important all this is to Gabi. 

Interestingly, to make a connection to real events, I think Isayama was kind of “inspired” by Hitler, his ideology and the events that came along with him. Because Hitler, as it should be well known, used the racial idea to accuse an ethnic group of evil acts, which they, as a matter of fact, never committed in the past or in the present. But people didn't care about that, because as long as you have an enemy, or rather a scapegoat, to whom you can assign everything bad in the world, then it's pretty easy to find approval as a result. It’s not necessarily the same case in Attack on Titan, but this blind hatred, which was given to all children from an early age, can be transferred here. For just as the children of the Third Reich despised the Jews, just as all of Marley's children despise the Eldia. Even the Eldia, as we remember Gabi, hate their own bloodline, but of course only the bad ones from the island of Paradis, since they are particularly depraved. The absurdity of this matter is easy to grasp, but unfortunately that's never enough. Once such a situation has arisen, it is difficult to resolve it again. 

Let's talk briefly about my boy Falco. His protective nature, especially when it comes to Gabi, becomes clear very quickly, e.g. when he tries to save her after she has thrown a grenade, although he puts himself in great danger. Wanting to sacrifice himself, Falco even wants to inherit the Colossal Titan, just so that Gabi doesn’t have to die. That shows what Gabi means to him. That being said, it’s even more unfortunate that he’s actually permanently nothing more than her appendage, and has to take blows all the time, just because Gabi had done something again. Both have quite a unique relationship to each other, but this gets clearer later in the anime.

What this episode is about mainly, however, is basically the same as the main theme of this season: War. Fighting another nation and willing to infiltrate it, Marley lives up to its name again. They didn’t even have a specific reason, because the two nations in fact didn't have a conflict with each other. The other nation only heard of Marley's failure on Paradis and took advantage of this situation mercilessly. In our world today, nations wouldn’t be attacked directly if they were in a phase of weakness. In contrast, this clearly shows how the world in Attack on Titan works. Dominated and destroyed by violence, all parties are fighting a never-ending war and, in the end, no one benefits from it. Maybe the winner achieves something, but even he has to fear for his supremacy (as seen in episode 2, that's one of Marley's problems too). And as we know, this wasn’t the last war Marley has to fight. 

Btw, not everyone, unlike our friend Gabi, thinks of war as such a great thing. Reiner's sentence: ""I'm sick of walls by now"" when he jumped down from the airship shows how much he wants to end these wars. Even if some Marley folks are so proud of their military achievements, I'm sure a lot of people, e.g. Falco, feel that way. Anyway, just wanted to mention that.

To close the circle for that episode, I'd like to highlight how good the very start of that season was. There we saw Falco, looking at the sky and watching the birds flying away, how they lived in freedom without any obstacles, in complete contrast to his situation. This was a pretty nice analogy to the very first episode of Attack on Titan, where Eren, lying on the grass, saw the birds soaring over the walls. This makes it clear once again how similar both sides, i.e. the Eldia from Marley and the Eldia from Paradis, are. Nothing distinguishes them in their hearts, only the desire for freedom and redemption slumbers in them. After all, that's one of the big themes of this season, more specifically the whole series. 

Moving away from the battlefield, we realize how much Reiner suffers from all of this. He blames himself for many things and finds it difficult to conclude with his past. Especially the scene when he told his family about his time in Paradis, or his nightmares about Mikasa and Levi, who tried to kill him, certainly show how the things he had to do left deep wounds on him. His near suicide proves how destroyed he was inside. Overall, I have to admit that he's really become the character I feel most empathic with. To sacrifice so much for the betterment of one's family, to have done and experienced bad things, without achieving anything and still to find oneself in the same hell over and over; I think this complexity is what makes a great character. 

In addition, when we were shown his past, it ultimately became even clearer why he would also like his sister not to inherit his titan. Reiner himself once believed that the world was divided into black and white and that everything would get better as soon as he only served Marley. That this, among other things, resulted from regaining his father, who had run away, shows his desperation. And be it Reiner's desperation or Gabi's hatred, ultimately both are so similar as one could hardly be. Reiner recognizes his younger self in Gabi, and therefore, he doesn’t want her to walk down the same dark path as he did. 

But I don't think that Reiner was the only one who was desperate of something at the time. Marcel, Porco's brother, was also only someone who was worried about his brother and tried to protect him. Likewise, his death made Reiner, Annie and Betholdt even more desperate. They were all eaten away by it. The whole world was eaten away by it. They only knew one way out, and that was to raze everything to the ground. The three of them were practically born with this hopelessness, which is why their actions were nothing but understandable. However, the fact that they still felt pity for the killed proves their humanity, which makes them more complete characters overall. In terms of character writing, Isayama proves that he’s undoubtedly one of the best.

But wait, there was someone else whose development had knocked me off my feet. And who could this be other than the so-called ""hope of mankind"" (laughs in genocide): Eren Jäger. At the very beginning of Attack on Titan, I thought he was nothing special, just a complete sucker who can’t do anything else than rushing blindly forward whilst shouting. Keeping that in mind, I've probably never seen such a change as in this fourth season though, that may be the biggest turnaround I've ever experienced. Some said he just came back with more anger, and now he’d be the edgiest character out there. That, to be clear, is bullshit. Because Eren hasn’t gained any anger, no, he gained something else, which is much more important than that: Clarity. In truth, Eren has shed his hatred and is now aware that there actually is no real enemy. As he talked with Falco, he said how much that world is plagued by hatred and violence and that this must come to an end. When he finally met Reiner, there was no malicious intent behind his actions. He admitted that they were the same, sharing the same fates. When he said he ""will go on until he wiped out the enemy,"" who said he was referring to Marley? After we learned that his and Zeke's goal is to kill all Eldia so that the world could finally find peace, we were certainly all surprised. We assumed that he was a psychopath who, driven by his god complexes and his hatred, wanted to destroy everything, really everything. But there is more to it than we think, and the fact that he is such an inscrutable character, whose actions and intentions can never be predicted, makes him a truly great character. Here, too, Isayama has once again outdone himself, and I am curious to see how he planned to continue the story. Maybe we'll get a Code Geass like ending, who knows? 

To go into it more detailed, episode 5, the episode in which Eren talked to Reiner and interrupted Willy Tybur's speech with his transformation was undisputedly glorious. The tension that resulted from the conversation between Reiner and Eren was very noticeable, and when he followed his words with deeds, I was really amazed. The fight against the titans, when the survey corps came to help Eren, when Reiner and Zeke stepped onto the battlefield, etc. All of this was incredibly well animated, despite the CGI. It's a real shame I didn't appreciate this until I watched it the second time, but that's just the way things are. Above all, Eren's cruelty becomes apparent once more when Mikasa said to him: ""Eren, do you see what you've done?"" as he showed almost no reaction to it. The leitmotif of this season comes to the fore again. 

Besides that, Gabi's hatred and anger emerges once again. No wonder when you watch all your friends die with the enemy right in front of you, little else can be expected. So she sneaked onto the airship with Falco and killed Sasha. Everyone was mad at her, but she felt the same way about those devils. Nobody tried to understand the other side, and hatred is known to only create more hatred. The never-ending cycle of war is portrayed by Isayama in a very straightforward way, whereby the cruelty reappears. Once again. It never seems to want to leave this world. This moment shocked me deeply and I realized that it had to come this way. Because that's how war works, and that's how our characters had to understand it, too. Once again a very meaningful scene, which was perfectly incorporated into the anime. 

When Gabi later lived with Sasha's family, a development of hers became visible. Like Reiner as a child, she thought the world was black and white, but her eyes were kind of opened then. Kaya, the girl who knew about Falco's and Gabi's origins, contributed a large part to all of this. But the forgiveness of the Braus family, or rather that Sasha's father forgave Gabi, this was the keypoint at which I think her attitude changed. A very beautiful and very realistic course of things, which was definitely necessary to see the world with different eyes. 

One last thing I would like to praise about the story is the political systems. Keeping track of it and aligning your story so that everything makes sense is a real art. Military governments, diplomacy, and rebellions (see the Yeagerists) have been excellently brought together this season in a way that is easy to understand. Chapeau to Mr. Isayama for this writing. 

I guess I could go into Zeke and his background, but since I don't have more to say about his actions being understandable if you know his past, I think I can leave it at that. The Yeagerists are an interesting group, from which I still hope for a lot, but it was clear that at some point Eren would attract fanatical people like Floch who would cooperate with him. So here too there is nothing more to write about. 

Overall, to summarize what I've wrote so far, the story and characters are great. Many twists, unexpected and shocking moments, as well as impressive fight scenes were incorporated. I didn't expect anything less, and although I was disappointed at first, Attack on Titan won me over once again. 

I intend to say something briefly about the animation. Tbh, I really couldn't stand the CGI Titans when I first saw them. I thought they looked like a pile of shit. And because I focused so much on them, I became a pessimist myself and ignored how beautiful everything else actually looked. The color scheme was appropriate, the character designs were very good, and they were also following the lines of the manga. I know that this case isn’t always a good thing (cries in Haiykuu), but it fits perfectly here. Many of the scenes were drawn in great detail, and all in all the animation was also good. The Rotoscope animation was a bit strange at times, but okay. And later on, I didn't find the CGI titans so bad anymore. Except for the monkey titan, because compared to before, he really didn't look good. Overlooking this, I would like to express my great praise to MAPPA, who unjustly endured a lot of hatred and anger. I am very happy that such a great studio as MAPPA has animated this season and I look forward to the further work of the animators and draftsmen!

The soundtracks of this season are in-fact very well done. It’s not overbearing during scenes with heavy dialogue. Furthermore, some of the fight scenes in the anime are accompanied with incredible songs that just get you hyped. Many of Hiroyuki Sawanos’ tracks were reused, which was a great decision, because these were sensational in many ways. Also the opening and ending songs are pretty special in their own way, but it certainly fits perfectly to the mood of the anime. The voice acting is really good, too, and that’s no wonder, because many experienced voice actors and talented people worked on that show, so it had to be great.

So what should I say what I haven't said already? This anime is truly a masterpiece, and the story and characters are also very well thought off. To think that we were given the chance to experience such a show is a blessing from the gods. I’m looking forward to the REAL final season, and hope that we’ll get it as soon as possible. Till’ then, I wish you a lot of fun watching anime!

"AoT Final Season, Shingeki no Kyojin, The Second Coming of Jesus Crust. This show's ""final season"" is quite great, but not nearly as amazing as Season 3 Part 2. For the impatient person reading this, the score is a 9.4/10 for me. Spoilers ahead.Lets start with where everyone had their problems was with the art. No Arifumi Imai's Red Bull infused action scenes or breath-takingly fluid and bombastic action scenes. There were some good scenes here and there but could never compare to Wit Studio's and Tetsuro Araki's work. The season suffered greatly due to scheduling and time related issues. Wit was overworked by theend of Season 3 Part 2 and didn't make all that much money off of it so they handed it to Mappa who scrambled to make it as fast as they could. What we got was good, it's still a good looking show, the CGI was actually good as far as anime CGI goes, and had some really well animated shots. But just good enough didn't really live up to the seasons that came before. I'm grateful that we got this and that it didn't get the OPM Season 2 treatment where it looked horrendous, but I wish it got the true 10/10 treatment we got before. 8/10

Sound was great, Kohta Yamamoto's track is great but it was overused. The opening is one of my favorites. The sound effects are all punchy and good. My only complaint here is some song choices here and there and Ashes on the Fire being overused. 9/10

The Characters were all great, Eren becomes such an asshole and as a result, you are forced to question who you're really rooting for. Mikasa is depressed as for usual (also rip to that ship). Armin and Reiner have become some of my favorite characters, I love the parallels drawn in Armins ""Im gonna nuke Liberio"" scene. One of the best scenes in AoT period. Gabi was the internet's punching bag and yeah, I hate what she did but she's interesting as fuck. Falco is great if you ask me. Zeke is Zeke but he now gets more than 5 minutes of screentime. Pieck, do I have to say anything? The characters had to drive the first 3 episodes and everything after the Attack on Liberio. So yeah, they all worked. Not as great as Season 3's excellent character drama but still really good. 9/10

The Story is where this season shined. Everything clicked to make this one of the most tense seasons of an anime I've ever seen. But it's not amazing. After episode 8 is buildup for the next part. While it's a good setup I enjoyed watching, it didn't wrap up as nicely as it did with Season 3 where you had more closure before the wait for Part 2. So we have a 10/10 setup that is an 8/10 on its own. This season works on promises. We have to wait to see them pay off, so I can't in good mind give it a 10 without seeing where they go. The story before episode 9 is fantastic. I really did dig the first 3 episodes (I love WW1 themed stories so yeah)  and the Attack on Liberio was fantastic Some of the best episodes put to air if you ask me. Overall, the story for this season is a hot 8.5/10.

Enjoyment is a 10. I loved this season. It's fantastic all around, but I doubt it'll hold up for the rest of the year until Part 2 comes out. This feels like Season 2, where it intentionally put the brakes on to build up for a better season. The payoff will likely be worth it in the end so I am optimistic about how things will turn out. So give it a shot if you haven't already. 

Overall, the show is good, built on promises kept and promising the world for the next part. While it wasnt the earth shattering season we all thought it was, this show executes parts perfectly and was the victim of its production hell. This would've been the greatest if the show had gone like FMAB and ended along with the manga but timing would ensure that would never happen. I'll wait around for the last part rather than buckle in for the manga so see you in Winter 2022!",2021-04-05T09:45:00+00:00,9
"Attack on Titan: The Final Season - (Season 4) [REVIEW]:[SPOILERS AHEAD]Introduction:I mean, it's not as damn near perfect as Season 3 Part 2, that season is a modern masterpiece. But Attack on Titan Season 4 Part 1 is, for the most part, up to standard with this show's consistent high quality and also, it's slow increase in plot quality and story intricacies. The world of Attack on Titan slowly expands even further as we begin the season being introduced to a whole new cast of characters from the distant land of Marley. At first, I wasn't sure what to make of this new band ofcharacters, given the fact that they're the literal antagonists since they oppose all of our favourites we've grown to love over the course of the last 3 seasons. But what Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season does so damn well, even better than previous instalments I'd say, is its characters and their arcs.

Characters:
I don't think there's a better example of this than with this season's newly introduced Gabi. She's gained a hell of a lot of hate from the fanbase, mainly because they can't stand anyone opposing their beloved Eren Jaeger. And while I love Eren to pieces too, Gabi is essentially just a mirror image over here, that can even be seen in her character design. The scenes in Marley after Jaeger's attack perfectly encapsulate those similar feelings of terror, anger and genuine hatred that came from Eren himself all the way back in season 1. The difference here is, Gabi is going through an extremely solid character arc after being let loose in Paradis and, in my opinion, season 4 is doing wonders with her character, almost to the point where even I'm starting to like her, and all I thought of her in episode 1 was that she was a cocky and annoying little shit. Episode 13 was incredible for character arcs honestly and Gabi's comes to somewhat of a turning point, at least I think, and I believe it'll have a big impact on her character moving forward. Seeing Sasha's father show mercy even after Nicolo's huge outburst seemed to have something of an impact on Gabi, for her to witness all of that and to see the father of the girl she killed show mercy just to stop this cycle of revenge, violence and hatred, it gives something of a hope that maybe the cycle of hatred between Marley and Paradis can finally end too. I don't know, I just think this season has been the best so far for character work throughout the whole of Attack on Titan and I think it's one of the best improvements. It's made the show slow down overall and it's probably a big part as to why it's split into two parts again, but I'm glad they're taking their time to tell a story with good characters that've all been carefully written and taken care of. This first part is a lot slower and overall, a lot less happened than in, say Season 3 Part 2, but the back and forth violence between Paradis and Marley as well as getting to see all the repercussions and effects all of this has had on each of the characters, I think it's nothing short of excellent. It's been a slower burn, but this is the build up towards the grand finale this show's been calling for and so far, I've really been enjoying the slower pace as everything slowly unravels, plans get revealed, characters go through arcs and each side begins to make their move, I'm really liking it. So character work has been exceptional, I thought Gabi might've been the best example to talk about since she goes through the most development across the season but other notable characters include Eren, with his drastic change from last seasons that still makes a lot of sense somehow, I think more will be revealed for him later on. Reiner, who's been a top tier character in this show from that fateful moment in season 2 and I think this season is no exception, giving us more insight into where his loyalties lie, getting to see his grief and guilt as well as depression and PTSD, he's still a really great character even if we don't get to see as much of him this time around. Zeke is improved a lot here too, we get to see more of his past with Grisha, he isn't just a one note antagonist anymore either, his rivalry and hatred with Levi is worked to the max this season and they do spend a lot of time together and his bigger plan is beginning to unravel more, especially since he got away again at the end of the season. Levi has some great moments, we see some of his regret and guilt over the choices he's made and my literal favourite episode this season ""Savagery"" focuses a lot on him and his inner turmoil. Mikasa and Armin have some pretty solid character work going on too and I think that overall, The Final Season has been a huge step up for characters, the plot slowed down a little and the overarching story has grinded to a halt for the time being but getting to see the interactions characters have with each other, the decisions each of them make and the development each of them go through, the season is worth it just for that.

Art &amp; Sound:
Okay so, here's the controversial section for this season. The show had a change in animation studios from the last season to this one. WIT to MAPPA. So it's a given that there'd be a style change and taking into consideration the amount of time MAPPA actually had to animate this season, I think they did one hell of a job because, for the most part, the show still look gorgeous. Yeah sure, colours are a little more muted, character designs have changed a little and the show's overall design is different. But it goes well with the change in show themes and the darker plot and character stuff. The animation is still fluid as all hell and most of the characters still look great, some are even an improvement I'd say. Eren, Levi, Floch, Jean, Sasha, Connie, Reiner, Zeke and more all look really damn good in my opinion and I think MAPPA's dedication to looking like the manga as well as what they achieved with such little time, I think it deserves some applaud just for that. Now saying that, it definitely isn't perfect, the CGI use still isn't all that great, although I never really thought it was in previous seasons, and sometimes when it's overused in certain titan fights, it does get a little noticeable and not distracting per say, but it's definitely something I and many others picked up on while watching. I'm not gonna give MAPPA too much slack for this seen as how little time they had but I just thought it was noteworthy, I mean looking at Jujutsu Kaisen, I can see what MAPPA can really do given enough time so I don't think it was a studio quality thing, I think it was definitely due to time constraints. SO for the most part, animation is still solid as all hell, I do miss some things from WIT's style but MAPPA have done a fine job at making the show look 90% nice as hell, the only exceptions being some CGI titans and now and again, characters looking a little weird in some shots, Armin, I'm looking at you. As for sound design, it's top notch, I really don't know what else to say. Dialogue and VA is top class as always and I fully enjoyed the dialogue writing in this season, it's in fact a big step up in my opinion. The score and music is gorgeous, the new opening and ending are like heaven to the ears and whenever classic themes or songs would kick in, notably in that last scene, I would honestly just lose my shit. The only complaint is that me, like many others, wish that YSBG was played during Eren's confrontation with Reiner in Marley, that's it though, it just would've made for some legendary parallels, maybe in a Blu-Ray release when they're going over it for improvements, they could add it in there as a nice surprise.

Story &amp; Plot:
Uhh, for the most part, the overarching story takes somewhat of a backseat this season in favour of character work and a leaning towards themes and messages and everything. It's still really solid but it does seem to be like 80% build-up for Season 4 Part 2 next year which will most likely be the more plot heavy  half of the season. The story moments that do happen such as Jaeger's attack on Marley, Gabi killing Sasha, Zeke's spinal fluid in the wine, practically all of ""Savagery"" or the table scene itself are all insanely great moments and the episodes where they appeared are all of my favourites this season but they are few and far between so I can't really give this season anything more than like an 8-8.5/10 for its story because there just isn't that much of it. Season 3B is much better for its plot personally and it's the only real big reason why I prefer it, but as I said, this season's character stuff and themes and messages as well as its writing and pacing are all phenomenal and more than make up for it and make this season completely worth it. 

Conclusion:
Overall Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 1 is close to a masterpiece, this show is still one of the best written anime ever and its intricate plot and world is to die for. I love this season's decision to spend equal time in Marley as in Paradis, it really helps for giving the audience perspective for both sides and looking up at Eren as the villain from Gabi's point of view rather that looking down on Marley looking for revenge was honestly the best way to do it. I'm glad they didn't go The Last of Us Part II route and have Gabi do something unforgiveable before we'd spent any time with her. The choice to do it the other way around and have literally half of this season progress before she does anything like that, it's definitely the best way to get the audience to feel internal conflict. Also seeing the cruel shit Eren does this season was more than enough for internal conflict too and I think what they've done with his character has been phenomenally well done honestly, he's gone from a so-so character to one of my favourites in just a season and I genuinely love how good the character work is this season, not just with Eren but with a lot of others too. Anyway, I really loved this first slow burn part to Season 4, I think it was really great build-up and it has a lot of great merits to stand on its own too. I just hope that next year, Part 2 delivers on the finale and makes The Final Season the best Attack on Titan has had to offer yet. It's a slight step down from Season 3B but I feel it's pretty equal with 3A so for a first part, it does a really solid job and if 4B can deliver, then I'm sure it can overall achieve a 10. I'll probably review more in detail once I've rewatched the whole show, read the manga and Season 4 Part 2 has finished but for now, these are my initial thoughts as well as everything I wrote for each individual episode but I really liked this season, Attack on Titan is still good as fuck.

4.5/5

"The original three seasons undoubtedly had a lot of soul in them, and WIT evidently played a part in this. The production team was able to craft a nearly-perfect adaptation of one of the best manga of the past decade, adding their own touch to make it something heartfelt and unique. However, the story told and the tone carried in these parts dies on chapter 90. The series that WIT beautifully adapted has ended, and it was only appropriate for another studio to continue the remaining manga content from here on. Nonetheless, MAPPA was able to fit the current feel of the manga incredibly wellin an anime format, with changes in both animation and direction styles reflecting the new, transformed face of Shingeki no Kyojin. All that remains is to see how chapters 117 to 139 are adapted in 2022.",2021-04-04T12:59:00+00:00,9
"it's quite rare to come across a story like AoT, in my opinion. seeing that it belongs to the ""Shounen"" genre, it's not generic. It's not all about the ""power of friendship"". It's got plot twists and so much depth. Eren's character growth was so well written. Even the side characters were written so well. There's very minimal fan service and I appreciate them so much for that. Most shounen anime is littered with fan service and a generic plot. I'm not overhyping when I say this anime is a masterpiece. The growth is steadily going up. I used to think it was just anothershounen action anime during the first season, but every new season kept getting better (especially as i also started reading the manga around season 2)

The soundtrack is also a masterpiece.",2021-04-03T02:25:00+00:00,10
"Attack on Titan Final Season was amazing! The last 3 seasons were absolute masterpieces so did AOT S4 disappoint? No! Every episode gets you hyped and you get to feel empathy for the characters, villains and protagonists, to the point you don't know who is right or who is wrong.The animation in past 3 seasons was made fantastically by WIT studio. After WIT decided to stop animating AOT, Mappa studio stepped up and animated AOT S4. The general style of AOT S4 was amazing, it made the season feel more dark and grim than the other season. One of the main controversies of AOT S4,you have heard was the CGI titans. I can't speak for anyone but personally the CGI was good and it was really smooth! The only nitpicks is the shadow of the titans and some color issues but overall it didn't bother me to the point of making me blind.

The music soundtrack was amazing! You get so hyped after time you hear the main soundtrack and you get your heart racing every time!

So in conclusion, the final season of AOT is a master piece. The music was good. The animation was good and just had some few nitpicks. The story is amazing!",2021-04-02T22:09:00+00:00,10
"I've been following this series since its first season, even got to participate a little in the wait for Season 2. When the series first came out, it received its fair share of haters, who insisted that the anime was massively overhyped and, in fact, bad. Even though I've given most of the seasons a 10, I can see why someone would think that way. However, as the anime progressed, the general consensus among hardcore anime enthusiasts shifted to an overwhelmingly positive reception. Perhaps this has to do with the slow set-up and persistent mysteries that the story has; one question would lead to severalnew ones. It was only recently that most of the unknowns were cleared up and all the threads began to untangle, leading to what we have in Season 4 - a consistent stream of episodes jam-packed with content, as addicting as it is layered.

Season 3: Part 2 is where the series has peaked for me so far, and as such, this season had a lot to live up to. Unfortunately, it took some time before it could do that. We start off with quite the time skip, and to top it off, an almost entirely new cast of characters. I won't go into much detail, but this did disappoint me severely for the first three-four episodes. It turns out there is a good reason to do such a thing and the idea is certainly novel and interesting, giving the storytelling a far less linear path. But taking the lead away from all these characters we've grown invested in to introduce us to ones that were quite mediocre for this first quarter.

An additional disappointment for many fans, including myself, was the severe drop in the quality of art and animation. I've seen quite a few ardent defenders of the change in animations studios, which I understand. The anime industry has been quite rough for a while and the demand for artists simply cannot be met, leading to some costs being cut. Wit were unable to fit in with the production schedule, so we switched to MAPPA. I understand it, but it doesn't mean I like it. The animation is too stiff considering how less detailed it can be. The overreliance on mediocre CGI makes battles look clunky, extending beyong the phlegmatic Collossal Titan I had grown used to. The art is servicable, which is a huge step back for ""Attack on Titan"". What makes it particularly disappointing is seeing such a change right at the end, whatever the reason might be. 

Now that I've spoken on my issues with the season, it's time I talk about what I love. The time skip makes character changes feel awkward, but it makes for quite the hook. Seeing what everyone has been up to and what the reasons for their actions are is only one of the reasons that kept me watching. Beyond that, there is not a single dull moment once the season gets going. There's always something that sets up a future plot point, which in turn continues the chain reaction until an unexpected climax is reach. SnK has had some of the best plot twists in modern media. They never feel cheap, are always thrilling, and manage to surprise me every time. And to top it all of, they often come in the form of cliffhangers. God, do I hate that we now have to wait until winter for this last one, I though waiting a week for the next episode was bad enough. Because truly, the episodes fly by. I can only imagine how fortunate binge watchers will be (if they managed to avoid spoilers, that is).

As I said, characters have changed and see further developments. Eren takes on quite a different role here. He's strayed far from the path to becoming a likable character, but he's become rather interesting on the other hand. Zeke gets to show us a more honest side of him, culminating in one of the season's best episodes in fact. Armin and Mikasa face much interpersonal conflict. Conny, Sasha and Jean have grown quite a lot. Levi is as badass as ever. Moral dillemas are everpresent and one of the main conflicts here has to do with discrimination and segregation. SnK does not shy away from delving into the topic's many points of view, presenting us with a nuanced view of the world. I dislike how convoluted theworld is shown as, when it is in fact quite straightforward. By the mid-point, though, I was able to picture the conflicts clearly. It's quite satisfying having most of the story's questions cleared. The question here is - what comes after?

While I did immensely enjoy this season and was on the edge of my seat throughout, I can't deny that the worse animation and rough start take it down a notch for me. Nevertheless, this is still a great watch and shows just how much this series has changed throughout its run. AoT stands as one of the most ambitious stories in recent times that shows no signs of losing its grip on the mainstream and hardcore fanbases alike.",2021-03-31T06:33:00+00:00,8
Anything about Attack on Titan is a masterpiece. It is the best and it should the top 1 anime. This really deserved a lot of love. A masterpiece is a masterpiece. It won't change the fact that Attack on Titan is the best anime. Please rate 10. It is the best of all the anime that exists. Very unique. The animation is so good. The drama gives so much feels. It is not your ordinary shounen that you see today. Its action scenes are not light-hearted and everything is so good. I really really love it. MAPPA really made a total masterpiece.,2021-03-31T03:54:00+00:00,10
"The fourth season of an already incredible series. If you thought that Season 3 was the peak of Attack On Titan, prepare to be impressed. Season 4 of this show takes the beautiful cliffhanger of Season 3 and completely delivers on everything viewers were expecting.We don't feel like either side is right, it just feels like two sides of the war. Newer characters and cooler titans. We also get a great amount of world-building. We spend 4 episodes building up, and it completely delivers. Story: 10/10 Amazing story. While there are small parts of exposition, it doesn't really matter, since what we have to makeup for it is already amazing.

Art 9/10
I've seen a lot of people complain about the CGI used in action scenes. The CGI however, is well-placed, with only a few slightly janky scenes. The animation in general is great. We have great character emotions, and backgrounds are well-drawn.

Sound 9/10
A lot of people miss Hiroyuki Sawano as the director of the last 3 seasons, but Kohta Yamamoto still does incredibly well. Ashes on the fire is phenomenal, with several different themes that fit each scene.

Character 9/10
Amazing characters. None of these characters are drawn as heroes, and the guys we are supposed to be on the side of. We get characters fighting on different sides of the war.

Enjoyment 10/10
Like the last 3 seasons, there's barely a dull moment. It's enjoyable and complex.

Overall 10/10
Absolutely amazing adaptation. Great animation, story and characters, and what's next is also great.",2021-03-30T18:25:00+00:00,10
"If we are talking about just the source material that was coverd this season, this is an easy 10/10, however as an animated adaptation this season unfortunately disappoints.It’s not that Mappa did a terrible job (with the resources they had available this is overall a commendable effort), but it’s hard not to feel that this part in the story deserved a little more.Let’s talk about the biggest elephant in the room, the CGI. This time around almost all titans that are in more than just one scene have become 3D models. In terms of CGI in the anime industry, it’s pretty good for a show.But unfortunately it is still noticeable and as the years go by these models will unfortunately age like milk.

But it’s not just the CGI that left this adaptation bruised, even action scenes rendered in 2D have taken a hit. Compared to some of the stunning action that was present in previous seasons, nearly all instances of Sakuga have been removed. The action does the job, but some moments could have had a bit more impact. 

This is coupled with a soundtrack that was unfortunately not helmed by Hiroyuki Sawano who has been in charge of Attack on Titans’ melodies all the way up to this point.  Again, the new music this time around does the job (there are even a couple of great tracks) but none of it really elevates its scenes to the next level.

Overall, if your main draw in the series was the story/characters and not the action and titans, you’ll love what this season has to offer.",2021-03-30T13:14:00+00:00,8
"Very disappointing. Undoubtedly, this is the worst attack on titan season of all time. I don't understand why this season finale is getting a rating of 9, but I'm guessing this is because of the bullshit respect campaign being called out by the weebs who think Mappa is the savior god of the series and it's okay if the animation is bad, because they are heroes who dare to take it. impossible project in the middle of busy with other anime projects (sounds stupid).I don't care about the things behind the scenes of this anime, what I criticize is how the quality of this animehas dropped considerably when compared to when WIT studio handled it.

Art + Animation 3/10: I'm sick of people saying that MAPPA's AOT animation is better than WIT just because the drawing style is closer to the manga version. It is as if they forgot what masterpiece WIT has presented through 3 seasons AOT which is arguably one of the most phenomenal Japanese animation works of this century. AOT MAPPA does not provide image quality that is comfortable enough to be viewed continuously without having to pause a little looking at your smartphone or your surroundings. Too much CGI in the titan battle scene is unforgivable for me personally because there are so many potential battles that would be much better if using 2D animation. For example, the Eren vs Warhammer battle. worst? Levi vs Beast Titan which is very disappointing

Sound + Music 3/10: Remember Erwin Charge? Armin's sacrifice? what makes those scenes one of the best tv series episodes of all time? Music. Placement of music that is right and right according to the scene makes the scene more lively and guides the audience's feelings to get into the story more. Does MAPPA AOT do it? unfortunately I personally don't think so. Maybe they tried, it just didn't work out badly. Ashes of Fire which is repeated many times, the selection of music that does not match the atmosphere of the story, and the placement of the music that is not right makes emotional and thrilling scenes not reach the audience

Character 6/10: Some of the old characters still have the same traits, but some changes in the old character traits like Eren who looks more aggressive make a good refresh on some sides. It's just that new characters like Yelena whose motives are too weak to go that far make the story seem forced to provide an antagonist.

Story 6/10: The story in this season finale includes everything in the manga version and no important things are cut so that the core points are maintained and keep the storyline in control until the end (it's just bad art and animation enough to make me bored a few times and tired of following the story). Marley-Eldia's politics were quite simple. Marley has a grudge against Eldia, and Eldia wants to be free from Marley. However, the narratives that each character brings to this issue are too circular and seem to be repetitive just to explain the same thing.

Enjoyment 5/10: Watching AOT Season finals is like doing a math assignment from your teacher. Annoying, but needs to be resolved. Several times I was irritated by the animation and the placement of the music.

The essence of my review is, AOT Final season is a drastic decline compared to the previous seasons. In my opinion, the quality that is delivered seems modest and does not have a sense of sympathy for the fans of this series. I don't care about schedules, or anything. If they dare to hold a project as big as AOT, then they should be ready for high quality demands",2021-03-30T08:16:00+00:00,5
"I am so glad I read the manga, cause honestly it saved me from watching the newer episodes and the utter disappointment that is MAPPA's animation, with Tetsuro Araki and Hiroyuki Sawano not working on AOT anymore almost everything that make AOT such an outstanding and unique anime is just gone.The amazing, weird dramatic and chaotic soundtrack that you can tell is Hiroyuki Sawano's work just brings so much life and honestly it was so good it was half the enjoyment of the first seasons along with the beautiful, fluid and awesome direction/camera movement.All the wonderful 3DM scenes are replaced with still shots of acgi character moving across the screen like they dragged a PNG across photoshop with their cursor, it hurts my eyes with the abysmal inconsistent framerate and it's just outright horrible, the only good thing I can say about the animation is that... the still shots are decent but the movements are just weird.

It's ok for the storytelling part, but the action is just... bleh, may as well watch that one fan animation.",2021-03-30T07:35:00+00:00,3
"The first thing I want to say about AOT is THANK YOU MAPPA. They did an excellent job adapting the manga and made this season so enjoyable. To begin, seeing Marley was one of my favorite parts of the show. It divides the viewers almost into sides. I love the connection to something like WWII, but that type of connection is to be made on your own. As the action began picking up in Marley, it becomes a very suspenseful and action packed show, carrying some of the highest rated episodes in AOT history. Once we hit the mid way point of the show, weget a little break and then BANG more action. The action, of course, carried important plots to the story that will matter later. The wine, Zeke’s backstory, and the Rumbling are all things that made this season so enjoyable. 10/10.",2021-03-30T06:49:00+00:00,10
"Honestly this was a pretty solid watch, I was intrigued by the dialogue and how it built up over the course of 4 seasons, and I was not disappointed in the studio change at all, though at times I did feel that the animation was a bit weak compared to what we've been spoon fed in the past seasons. This season was proof that it was the story of the anime that made fans come back, not the animation. I felt that this season was missing that punch that would have led me to give it a 10 out of 10, but frankly this seasonfelt like it was a counterpart to something greater, and it's edging us onto the tip of the ice berg. I was hoping for more, but nonetheless I was satisfied with what we were given. And without a part two to season 4, I don't think I would have given it an 8. Consider this an investment, I'll be expecting a 10/10 in part 2. 

The context of the show was reliant on how well you've paired attention to what's been going on in the past couple season, and even I, somewhat of a attack on titan anime only connoisseur, I had no idea what the fuck was going on during some episodes. but knowing AOT, it was probably gonna be important sooner or later. The progression of the story felt a bit rushed at times, and I don't think it stayed true to the lore at points, as I was hoping for some more context on a handful of characters. Who knows? maybe there'll be more in the coming season. 

overall
8/10
solid show, but not enough to be called a masterpiece (as of now)",2021-03-30T04:02:00+00:00,8
"Finally I can write a proper review after S4 part 1 is finished. I'm quite surprised with people who hated animations and stuffs like that, I can agree CGI was not the best (not even done by MAPPA) while MAPPA did an extremely accurate character and world design similar and better compared to manga in my opinion. Most people prolly just hate the studio or AOT like many hate FMA (that's why both have an extremely high number of 1 as vote) infinite battle..By the way I really enjoyed this first part although the best one will be the part 2, this one except someepisodes it was pretty calm and politic oriente, which is fine of course. I appreciate how they put every particular in it without rushing it non sense. (I'm glad of this since nowadays many anime rush af the story).

Let's wait part 2!",2021-03-30T03:21:00+00:00,8
"Honestly, the last part was better, the animation in this season is worse, but it's not that of a big deal, the action was good and many times pretty epic, but there are some things that doesn't make sense to me yet, maybe they will explain that on the final season but I feel this part a little hollow, like, if something is missing, idk, it was good tho, pretty enjoyable and I recommend itAlso, another thing the music was good but older seasons had better OST, the ilumination in a lot of scenes was way too dark, sometimes I almost didn't see anything onthe screen, way too dark that made things to seem kinda blurry",2021-03-29T18:36:00+00:00,9
"I think the story is holding up decently well, as it always has in regards to SnK. Maybe a little more convoluted this season given the scope has increased tenfold, so that's understandable. However, I usually rate anime based more on the production, animation, voice acting, etc. since I can just read the manga if I purely want the story (barring anime originals, obviously).I felt a lot of the overall production had some glaring flaws related to animation, editing, and pacing, much more so than previous seasons: off-model characters, strange cuts and cinematography, several off-putting scenes mixing 2D & 3D animation (while others were blendedwonderfully, making the choppier scenes stand out all the more), and certain emotionally-charged dialogues that ended up falling flat. Personally, I'm not overly fond of MAPPA's works for varying reasons, but I know they can at least make stunning-looking works (e.g. Jujutsu Kaisen). That being said, I know it's truly the fault of of higher-up execs and producers for insisting on the rush job, so I put the entirety of the blame on them.

I gave this season a 6/10, nearly bordering on a 7, for the reasons of a) it not living up to past seasons and b) feeling that a great work in anime such as this should be judged with a higher level of criticism.

I look forward to Part 2, and genuinely believe that MAPPA (given they are indeed the ones working on it) can redeem the qualms of Part 1 and send Shingeki no Kyojin out with a bang.",2021-03-29T17:09:00+00:00,6
"Art: (7/10)I have mixed feelings about the new artstyle. On the one hand, it's really not as bad as the community has been making it out to be, and is IMO far from ugly. Some of the new character designs are really cool, and reflect how much both the characters and the show have changed over the years. Eren is no longer a naive screaming teenager, and his design changes to reflect that. Reiner just looks so much older and tired than he did in the rest of the show, which fits perfectly for how his character is going. Some, on the other hand, don'tlook quite as amazing. Like, I'm not the only one who thinks that Armin and Mikasa's new designs look weird, right? Same with the new characters, some of them just don't look right. Also, I'm just now starting to notice just how many characters in this show are blonde. 

And with regards to the animation...I think it looks fine. The CGI is a little jarring sometimes, and the fact that there isn't a ton of action means that a lot of scenes are just talking heads, which gets a little boring to look at after a while. I'm hesitant to call it as gorgeous as the other seasons, but I personally believe it miles above that of Season 1. Plus, the visuals for the intro are just incredible. 

Characters (8/10):
Season 4 introduces a vast number of new characters, to accommodate the fact that it's an actual war now, rather than just human's vs titans. Some of these new characters are great, most are inoffensive enough, but I personally think that there are a few too many. Especially in the latter half of the season, the number of characters introduced seemed a tad excessive, and we weren't given any reasons to particularly care about most of them. 

However, I do respect S4 for how it handles its old characters. We get to dive deeper into the psychology and backstory of the Marleyan characters, as well as an interesting new take on the older characters, and an incredibly compelling new villain that I don't think us anime-onlys were expecting. Some of them don't get as much development as others, but that's only to be expected with a cast as large as AoT's. Still, most of the new and old characters are interesting and fun to watch.

Story (9/10): 
Attack on Titan has never had a particularly complex story. This isn't to its detriment, as the earlier seasons of AoT are elegant in their simplicity, with their simple ""Humans vs monsters"" narrative. The appeal of the older seasons was in their action and world-building, which only grew better and better as they went along. The goal up until Season 3 was to find out what was in the basement in shiganshina, and by extension what was beyond the walls. Now that that promise has been fulfilled...what's left? Where do you go from there? 

Most of Season 4 is devoted to answering that question, as the island of Paradinza finds itself part of a larger world, and a bigger target for its enemies than ever. It's very distinct tonally and plot-wise from the other seasons, as the story shifts from ""human's vs. monsters"" to ""humans vs humans"". The moral certainty that was nearly always present in the other seasons is gone now, and things aren't going to get any simpler going forwards. 


Sound: (10/10)
Attack on Titan has always had great music, and Season 4 continues that trend with some truly great new songs, and a fresh take on the old ones as well. Let's be honest, we all thought My War was a little weird at first, but it grows on you, and I honestly can't imagine a more fitting song for this season. 

Enjoyment: (8/10)
This final season has a different style and tone to it than the other seasons, but I still do recommend it to anyone who's gotten this far. Sometimes it falters in the pacing department,  sometimes the new characters aren't as interesting, and sometimes the animation isn't amazing, but ultimately it still has the same brilliance of the other seasons behind it. It's not perfect, but I'd still recommend it. 


OVERALL: (8/10) 
GREAT, GO WATCH IT. 


TL;DR: While Season 4 isn't quite as strong as the other AoT seasons, I'd argue it maintains the same level of quality in certain areas, and takes the admittedly simplistic story of Attack on Titan in a bold new direction.",2021-03-29T10:33:00+00:00,8
"First, sorry for my English and lack of vocabulary, this is my first review I hope you like it.Maybe some minor spoilers ahead In MyAnimeList when you give a rating to a show, a 10 out of 10 appears as the word “Masterpiece” … Now, for me the most amazing thing about art is the capability of it meaning different things to everyone who consumes the piece of art in question, so the conceptualization of what makes something a “Masterpiece” varies with the interpretation of every single being on art in general.   “Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season” is to me a “Masterpiece”… and without going into much detail let me tell why. 
 
When I first watched Attack on Titan season 1 with my older brother, I was a little kid, and to this day, despite the amazing production values and the cruel visuals of the show, the first and second seasons are nothing more to me than good action/shounens with not much detailed to story writing, except one or two plot twists. Attack on Titan was just good like many other shows (8 out of 10’s). When season 3 first came it was different, it finally showed us that there is something more to this cruel but generic good vs. evil world of Attack on Titan. The action kept and bettered it’s insane production values, the exposition was overall good, the character development was great and what we now knew could change the route of the show to a more deep story progression with even better plot twists and moments, as we were introduced to some of the most vital and important concepts of show; season 3 (8 out of 10) opened the doors to a great worldbuilding and the complex history of it’s world that would eventually lead to a season 4. 

 I usually like to say that season 3 part 2 (9 out of 10) is my favourite shounen/action anime of all time (maybe on par with One Piece and FMAB) because of its unmatched packed action and feeling, I think some of the most hype moments in television history are found in this season, as well as just awesome pace, characters, mysteries and again… its moments. There’s not much I can say about part 2 besides it is that good. I also think it was really interesting to show what the outside world is like trough Grisha’s perspective, and finally I love the conclusion of the show, it feels like everything is now finished, it’s the end, and now we move on to the bigger picture that is season 4. 
 
Attack on Titan changes studios, from legendary WIT to the insane MAPPA. Season 4 was made in approximately 8 months if I’m not mistaken, which is an utterly small period of time for such a big show, but honestly, I think this show exceeded my expectations in every way possible. First let’s talk about the main focus of the season- Story. 

 I could have never expected in 2013 that Attack on Titan would be at where it is right now, the quality of writing and story telling here is frankly some of the best I’ve ever seen ever, and I’m not talking just about anime but every art form that involves story telling. It is unpredictable, hype, deep, complex, well-paced, interesting, unique, and mysterious. Normally many shows present questions just for the sake of keeping the audience sufficiently interested in the story, and for the most part these questions are just that, bait for the audience to hold on to, ending up to be plot holes or just uninspired and predictable subplots, but Isayama had been presenting mysteries since the very beginning of the show , not just to make the audience keep watching, but to develop the story itself, Attack on Titan feels like a big mystery with many question marks, but well thought out ones, that when they are ultimately responded help the story progress to it’s culminating conclusion. 
 
Season 4 isn’t an action show anymore so don´t expect to have many packed hype fast paced scenes, instead this season shows us the world that we’ve been following for years, it shows us what is actually happening, responding to many of our long existing questions, and presenting new ones given the context of the show. “The Final Season” is the beginning of the end, an end that I’ve been theorising since the first episode aired but I still have no concrete answer to, an end where everything leading up to it feels like it has a purpose in the bigger picture, an end where everything can still happen, and to me this is what’s special about season 4, it is so interesting it keeps you hooked like nothing else, you just want to know the answers and what’s happening next, you want to know what are these characters secrets and motives because they are so well written, you want it to end, so you can finally understand everything, but at the same time you don’t want it to end so you can see more of the show and keep theorising and thinking and enjoying yourself. No other show as presented a story so interesting as this one, it doesn’t rely on emotion, mystery, shock value, etc. it only relies in its amazing writing quality and rightfully so. 
 
“Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season” scores and comments.
 
Technical Value (40%)

Story-10/10 (15%) 1,5. I said it all, just one of the most interesting, well written, well progressed stories ever imo.

Music and Sound 10/10 (10%) 1. No problems with the sound design for the most part. Sawano is a beast and AOT as one of the best soundtracks in Anime history. Also stop bitching about the osts, I can understand if you don’t enjoy the choices here or there but no need to bitch about it like it’s the fucking end of the world. The music choice imo was perfect and well chosen, the soundtrack is supposed to make sense with the corresponding scene and not just to sound good and hype, if so turn down the volume and watch AOT listening to Radiohead.

Art 10/10 (10%) 1. The art is great, loved what MAPPA did with the look of the show, it feels darker and more serious, as well as matured, which makes since the characters have matured themselves.
Voice Acting 10/10 (10%) 1. I think everyone can agree here. Amazing performances from everyone, the delivery and intention are there, and one more thing that I really appreciated is the fact that Yuki Kaji’s performance is so good that we don’t know what Eren’s real intentions and motives are, or do we?

Animation 8/10 (10%) 0,8. Even though the animation isn’t so important this season, unfortunately it isn’t as good as what WIT had given us but it’s still good, the 2D animation does the job for the most part with some let downs and strange movements here and there but overall, really nice. The CGI is surprisingly decent, though it would’ve been way way better to have seen the action parts in full 2D, I understand that MAPPA didn’t have the time to do so and so I appreciate the effort they´ve put into trying their best to make the CGI look sufficiently good. Also, I it blows my mind how someone can call AOT CGI bad, yes it is not that good but it’s also not even close to bad, I recommend you to see EX-ARM or 2016’s Berserk adaptation. 

Cinematography 8,5/10 (10%) 0,85. Not much to work here since there aren’t any wonderfully beautiful backgrounds but the way it’s shot, the art, and the colour patterns are all really good all throughout. 

Characters 10/10 (10%) 1. So well written, character design is nit, new characters are compelling, backstories are fascinating, already existing characters are given the deserved respect, and engaging relationships and scenarios between characters. Nothing bad to point out.

Overall enjoyment 10/10 (25%) 2,5. Just Wow, thanks to Isayama and MAPPA.

"I think that this season produced by studio MAPPA adapts perfectly the story of the manga, with very good animations and also very good CGI, something really rare in the world of japanese animation. The events in this first part of the season are just epic, from the amazing action scenes to the more political aspects of it. The characters keep changing, especially Eren and Reiner, that now have a more deep characterization than before. Also the supporting characters are amazing and the story keeps getting more and more intriguing. As a manga reader I can only say that if you liked this first partof the season, well the second part will be even more amazing and unbelievable. I assure you that you will remain even more ecstatic than before!",2021-03-29T04:34:00+00:00,10
"If I could re-watch this season for the first time, I'd quell the hype (and criticism) from fans and simply let the show take me where it goes. But I unfortunately let the hype get to me, and I was disappointed severely by the last episode. It wasn't even bad, it was very good, it just left off so unsatisfyingly that it negatively affected my opinion of the season as a whole. But it's what I get for listening to the hype and ""Y'all ain't ready"" posts from every other fan.So, positives. The story is very compelling, flipping the point of view to the Eldians'""enemy"" and going from there. It evokes great themes and great conflicts and is nicely complex without being utterly confusing. I struggled to decide whether I liked the characters, but they're ultimately the best part of the show even though I'm not hoping for their success. Yeah, that includes that one notoriously hated character (whom I also hate). Every one of them is given some dimensionality and development, and it's saying a lot that it effectively pulls apart a fanbase with whom to root for. I, personally, being the misanthrope that I am, want Eren to succeed with what I think he's trying to do (though I'm still unsure since he's arguably the one who's kept most detached from the viewer the entire season).

On the semi-critical side, I saw some complaints about the animation style and I guess I sort of agree with some of them? It does look different and a bit weird at times, though it's not drastically different to the extent it ruins scenes in the show. The music was also good though not great, since nothing stood out save for the opening theme.

On the more critical/nitpicky side, I gotta mention that last episode again. Gosh, that cliffhanger just disappointed me so much I felt actual anger. I usually wait until a show/season is fully released, and this isn't entirely a fault with the show since it's how a TV format goes, but... as far as a ""season"" goes, the last episode didn't cap it well for me. Looking back on certain parts of the story I also felt like the pacing could've used some tweaks to get the oomph I got from previous seasons. Like Season 3 Part 1, my absolute favorite of the series, has a clear progression and feeling like something truly happened (following a typical plot structure). This season felt only like a steady rising action and then no payoff. Of course, it's unfair for me to say nothing really happened since there were some serious developments, though the majority of it was setup for what will be coming in The Final Season Part 2. So... This season is good, though left me disappointed. Yeah.",2021-03-29T00:33:00+00:00,8
"This season suffers a lot compared to previous seasons in terms of animation, sound design/usage, and direction. But the source material is so good that the season is still good anyways. The CGI does not look good. It doesn't matter if it's comparatively good to other CGI anime, as animation, it does not look good. In fact it's quite jarring, unpleasant to look at, and unimmersing. I just wanted to quickly get that out of the way, only people in denial think the 3D is on par with real, quality animation. Even the 2D animation blatantly lacks polish and consistency. Compare the hand drawn workto previous seasons or even MAPPA's other series(Jujutsu Kaisen) and you can tell there is much less polish and time put into even the hand drawings. Yes I know Kodansha is bad and MAPPA is a unethical studio that overworked and rushed their animators, but it still doesn't make it look any better.

The chilling soundtrack incorporation seasons 1-3 is longer here. Instead we have strange or underwhelming song choices. Personally I wasn't upset over the Declaration of War transformation OST, but I wasn't impressed either. It was just an easy re-used song. That's a common theme this season, underwhelming or re-used songs. A few songs are also overused in moments to create dramatic effect and it just does not feel natural at all. In terms of sound design outside of OSTs, there are just strange sound uses throughout the season. For example, when Eren unplugged the War Hammer Titan, it sounded like some shitty SFX noise, I have never heard or expected such a low quality sound from this series. The season also uses the thriller acceleration noise sound effect at ANY chance it can(e.g. revealing that Sasha died). The overuse of this thriller sound effect makes the show seem so much more juvenile than it needs to be. 

Although the story and plot has deepened tremendously since seasons 1 through 3, this season can feel weightless at times. Scenes just are not hitting, even though more intense plotlines are occurring. The movement and animation choreography is extremely basic and simple, the ODMG movement scenes were butchered. If you watch the first episode of AOT, or the episode in which Erwin lays down his life, you can instantly tell the difference in direction, cinematics, and beauty that is put into the important scenes of the show. Season 4 in comparison is flaccid, weightless. Halfway through the season the pacing slowed to 1 chapter per episode. This season was mostly exposition, and the slow pace did not help either. Because I watched this weekly, It wasn't dragging for me. But in a rewatch you would definitely be able to tell the pacing of the exposition isn't as fast and intriguing as you would want it be. They decided to leave all the climaxes of the show to be shown in part 2, that's fine with me, but as a result this season(part 1) suffers as a result. 

Even though I have ALL this criticism, I still believe this season is an 8/10. this is solely because of Hajime Isayama's story carrying the show, not the the production studio for the anime.",2021-03-28T23:17:00+00:00,8
"This was another amazing season and an emotional one on top of that. I've always loved this show but this season was the first time I cried because of an episode. The storytelling is masterful, the art at the beginning was a little strange and had some not so stellar CGI, but I believe that if people didn't know the anime changed studios, they wouldn't have protested so much and wouldn't even notice the little dip in quality in the first few episodes. Sadly, the show has gotten so big, that there are a few rotten apples in the fanbase and there are people whojust want to complain and shit on the things they love. If you think the show is ruined by this masterful adaptation, you should go and see what happened with The Promised Neverland, go and see the CGI in EX-Arm or Berserk(2016).",2021-03-28T22:38:00+00:00,10
"Spoiler free!Wow! just wow! I'd say this is definitely going to be remembered by us 10 years from now and say ""That was amazing."" I haven't seen something something so hyped in the anime community since probably the ending of Naruto. This is the beginning of the end for one of the largest continuing anime in the last decade and it is not going out with a bang.Storywise. What can i say, it is a masterpiece. There is nothing i can see as wrong or stupid about it. I haven't caught up with the manga precisely so that I can experience the story to it'sfullest.

Artwise. let's be honest, even though I love MAPPA and their works, it is not superior to WIT. It's gleaming giants called titans are now using CGI. But on the contrary, it's almost not noticeable and most definitely not ruining the show whatsoever. 

Sound is amazing and even a step up in some ways, especially when comparing it to the first season.

Characters are still the ones we know and love with the addition of new ones to provide awesome variety and substance, on the exception of one very annoying young girl that i cannot understand whatsoever. She doesn't really have a great backstory or reason, she's just there for the sake of being there and to antagonize the original main characters. But for the vast majority of other characters, their transformations from prior seasons is unexpected and amazing, it makes you ask, what happened? why did they do this? and it shows that characters have grown. 

Overall, If you like AOT, then you will love this. highly recommend it if you haven't watched it for some reason",2021-03-28T22:18:00+00:00,9
"[WARNING, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]Note: This is not the end of Attack on Titan, there is going to be a part 2 to this season if you haven't already guessed by now.Over the years, Attack on Titan has continued to evolve both in popularity and story. It is one of a few shows where the main genre has completely shifted. It went from a shounen to shounen/seinen to now almost being entirely seinen. The final season, or rather final season “part 1” is a perfect example in showing the evolution of the story and how much the characters have changed. This show has truly setthe stage for what is inevitably going to be the very last conclusion of this amazing story.

Story - 10/10
Probably one of the best stories in a very long time. Here we see the last two arcs (roughly 25% of the last one) in its fruition. The first 4 episodes took us in a different setting to allow us to learn about the new characters that we would be seeing for a while and sure enough we learn just enough to know the most important part of attack on titan’s themes and motifs. No one is a hero or villain in this story. Everyone has been brought up differently by the secrecy, propaganda and brainwashing their people enforced upon them and what we see in the final season is the result of what these characters have become because of that. The story overall is much more violent, aggressive, darker, gloomier, and sad than any other season before it.

Art - 8/10
This was probably the most controversial aspect of this season due to the change in studios from WIT to MAPPA. Many people complained about the new art style of the characters, but they particularly were critical of MAPPA’s use of CGI. Majority of the titan battles employed this unique form of CGI that differed a lot from WITs. Whether you see that as a better or worse thing is really up to you, but it was definitely unusual than one would expect, you would have to watch it yourself to see what I mean and understand where all the hate possibly came from. The animation itself in the long run was great overall, many moments looked so beautiful to look at and honestly better than some of the manga panels to be honest. MAPPA is covering for the eventual part 2 of this season but it seems they are being rushed to get this out like the first part. With the time constraints and backlash they were given, they all still did a decent job adapting.

Sound – 10/10
This first part didn’t really need such a powerful OST like the first 3 seasons because these arcs do not prioritize in putting constant action in your face but rather show a more sadistic and cruel way of fighting. People who complain about their favorite track not being used in a certain moment don’t really appreciate the impact of said tracks. The consensus was that the staff should have reused OST’s from some of the most shocking and revealing moments in the series but reusing them lowers the impact it had when it was first heard. Of course we do hear some portions of some of the previously used songs but the new OST was still primarily dominant. The soundtrack is amazing. Both the opening and the ending themes, though weird to start…started to grow on I think all of us by the middle of it. These were good choices because it perfectly fits the mood and the tone this season is supposed to take in addition to the new OST and I’m happy the staff and the orchestra did that. Voice acting is superb, and everyone makes their character so believable. You can really see all the emotions, and feelings the characters feel so well. The cast at this point has reached all-star level and it will probably only get better from here.


Character - 10/10
The final season has some of the most well written arcs and our characters have developed so much even in ways you didn’t expect. Our main cast changes their look in the 4-year gap but the most notable 2 to have changed so much since we last saw them is Eren and Reiner. Eren is likely the one who has changed the most, not because he’s simply the main character but also because of his motivations and ambitions. Here we see him in a much gloomier, darker, and a more violent matter because of the events that transpired and were revealed to him and his actions reflect that. Reiner on the other hand whom we likely initially hated at first grew on me because we learn much of his backstory as well as his life beyond the walls. The season shows us how mentally unstable he became throughout the course of the story and is suffering due to his trauma and horror he faced. These two guys have totally changed the personalities of their companions, and it really shows near the end of the series. At first, we see sasha die because of gabi and her vendetta against eldians but ultimately, it was Eren who had inevitably dragged the survey corps into Liberio. Her death ruins the trio of her, Connie, and Jean. Connie, who was someone we believed would bring the bright side of this story is now completely in distraught and fosters hatred towards Eren and his followers. Another example is when someone like Armin who is someone who fought for Eren to death and was a close friend of him for almost all his life, take no time in thinking of hurting him for the sake of Mikasa. Mikasa whom Eren saved when they were young and was friends with for a long time shows his true feelings toward her and Armin. Even some of the side antagonists have developed such tragic stories when you see how much war has hurt them at a such a young age. Gabi and Falco in the 16 episodes have been exposed to their enemies but also tried to blend in with them for a period of time, all while keeping the preconceived notion that the eldians are devils (particularly gabi). We see both learn that they are virtually the same and see the tension when the other race tries to bond with the others. These are just some examples on how messed up everyone can get but in a compelling way too.

Enjoyment - 10/10
From start to finish, every episode was excellent and delivered enough or more to get me intrigued for every single new episode. There are moments where it really leaves you on the edge of your seat. You’ll probably be telling your self “Oh my god”, “oh shit”, “what the hell” or any other variation of those phrases a lot because there are so many 180’s and plot twists you don’t expect to happen but they do. If you’re someone who wants or loves a lot of action and awesome scenes, you will have to wait a bit as this season is a little patient with that. After episode 5, it’s just pure anarchy.

Overall - 10/10
Clearly one of the best seasons or even a show in general out there that anyone can watch. It is wonderfully crafted and subverts expectations in a positive way. It tries to shift genres mid way, which although is a very risky move, it is done very well. I’m so excited for part 2 or should I say the epic conclusion to this series in a few months and I hope you are as well.

"Alright, Imma do something dangerous.Give a 7 to AOT.WEEB JAEGERIST - ""Wait dude!! But its a masterpiece! Nothing short of a 10/10""Hear me out.First of all. This rating is reflective of this season. AOT Final Season Part 1. Not AOT as a whole.I'll agree that AOT is truly something else, a phenomenon the likes of which we see once every decade or two. But just because something is popular doesn't mean its inherently good.Lets talk. This season adapts the Marley Arc and sets up the final ""War for Paradis"" Arc. No matter how you look at it, the world of AOT has been truly expandedand the rules have been redefined, Titans are not the biggest threat anymore, fellow humans are. This dynamic is what allows AOT to truly shine amidst a bunch of anime focused solely on fights/war/strategies. However, you can't disagree that all this season is about is World-Building and setting up the final leg of the series. Due to this, the series suffers from what one might call, the ""pseudo-filler syndrome"".

ANIMATION
MAPPA has been getting a lot of flak from so called OG AOT fans for ""BAD ANIMATION, 3D BAD, BRING SAKUGA!!"". I personally liked the direction MAPPA took. Surely, the finished product ain't as polished as the WIT seasons, but considering they only got around 8 months to animate it, along with all the other things they have their hands full with(like JJK), it was all nicely animated, bearing very close resemblance to the manga art. Still, the scenes are sometimes jarring, the direction is great at some places, meh at others. A strong 7/10.

SOUNDTRACK
The OP+ED are fine. They don't hype you up or anything, but they do a respectable job at setting up the mood. The soundtrack is very forgetful. Apart from spamming the ""Eren Transformation music"", the soundtrack really doesn't have much to offer. It's just fair, I guess. 6/10

CHARACTERS
The characters in AOT, well, are good. Some more than others. But with the scale of the story dialled to 11, not all the new characters you introduce are gonna be fleshed out as they should be. Gabi, great. The chef/Sasha's lover, great. Sasha's sister, goood. Zeke, goood. BUT THAT'S IT. All the other titan shifters, Marleyans, Zeke supporters, these characters are defined alright, but we never truly understand them or the way they act. Eren's character has had a great arc, however the transition from ""Please Save Armin instead of Erwin"" Eren to ""You are not free"" Eren was kind of abrupt. Still, this is one aspect AOT doesnt disappoint much in. 8/10

STORY/PLOT
This is, honestly, a mixbag at this moment. The world has been introduced, the Eldian-Marleyan rivalry has been put out, the character motivations have been sort-of explained. Thats it. As I previously mentioned, this arc is all about setting up the final arc of AOT, and while it is one of the better arcs in the story, it just doesn't do justice to the viewer. Don't get me wrong, its a great arc, just not something I'll watch/read again. It's one of those ""taking too long to get going"" arcs. Now we got to wait another year to see a resolution to a story that started in 2011? *SIGH*
The story is not very emotional, even when it has all the chance to be. The characters and their interactions, their dynamics, all have potential to make you feel something, but you don't feel much of it. Because the series gives too much emphasis on the ""sheer scale"" and ""war aspect"" of things. It doesn't bother showing you the darker side of things, when it attempts to(like when Eren attacked Marley), it just doesn't do a good job. 
The world building is alright. Not nearly as fleshed out as it needs to be. Whatever happened to the Azumabitos?
Also, the pacing is all over the place. Some episodes just drag on, while others give too little time to moments that can truly shine. Overall, 7/10.

ENJOYMENT
Personally, I enjoyed S3 P2 more. It had higher stakes, better reveals, noble character moments, interesting moral dilemmas, much more exciting. Maybe because of that, S4 P1 suffers from ""EXPECTATIONS"". Plus the fandom has really kind of become ""toxic"", where they won't take even a pinch of criticism for the series and would go to lengths such as devaluing other series just so that AOT rises in the ranks. One's enjoyment of a series has to take a lot of external factors into consideration.7/10

I look forward to the next season, but if they don't nail the ending(The manga's ending is not looking good), this season would have been trip to downtown.",2021-03-28T21:09:00+00:00,7
"After all this time we finally get to see the rest of the world that is open up in Attack on Titan, and all the stories in Marley from Grisha to Zeke to Reiner were all interesting and well done. Looking into the society of Marley and how it compares and contrasts with Eldia was fascinating to learn about. After having a pretty straightforward story in season 1, and revealing how mistaken that all is at the end of season 3, this now shows the details of Marley that reveal the same prejudices and warring factions as the show presented within the walls previously. Perspectiveshave been changing rapidly and now I am not sure who is really anything like a good guy in this conflict. Seeing all the old characters wearing all-black uniforms and basically performing a terrorist attack is not something to take lightly after everything else that's happened and how other characters have been judged and killed.

So everything is up in the air, and while I am catching up with the manga, I really don't know how it will all wrap itself up or even what it all means. I like the steppe landscape of Marley and WWI-era technological development. The new characters match up well with the old cast (particularly Gabi and Eren) and while I was drawn in by the OP, I really love the string harmonies of the ED. The openings and endings have always been strong in AoT and MAPPA didn't miss that. I'm fine with their redesigns and CGI usage, it kind of gives a rough style like the manga itself. When I've finished a season of AoT, I've always sat back and listen to the music and just remember the plot and images of the show, without trying to make some specific judgement of it, which I think is always a sign of creating good art.",2021-03-28T18:58:00+00:00,10
"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERSTo me, Attack on Titan is a masterpiece. I’ve been an Attack on Titan fan since 2013, I’ve watched it in sub and dub multiple times, I’ve read every manga chapter up to 138 and the spinoff novels, I even own some of the manga so this review should have at least a little credibility. Attack on Titan has gotten better in every aspect with each new season and season 4 is no exception. It is the best season of Attack on Titan that we have gotten so far and when the second part comes out it will get even better.Watching these 16 episodes over the last 5 months, seeing the critical acclaim it has gotten inside the AOT community and out, and seeing the fan interaction has been my favorite experience with Attack on Titan since the show first came out back in 2013. Enough personal ramblings, let's talk about what makes this season of Attack on Titan so great, I’ll try not to spoil much and keep it as objective as possible.

The story of season 4 is elevated even further from previous seasons, doing everything they did well better. We get perspectives from both sides which helps us understand each side's struggles and motivations. Our thoughts change from season 3 part 2, before we thought Paradise was good and the people on the other side of the ocean were bad but now we realize that there is no good or bad just doing what you have to. We question if we should hate the supposed enemies from Marley or if our heroes from Paradise are doing the right thing. The narrative flows incredibly smoothly, the pacing of each episode is perfect and allows the story to be told methodically, getting just enough information per episode with a cliffhanger at the end that leaves us wanting to know more. The new information we get and the twists in the story leave us astonished but not confused. It comes out of nowhere but it all makes sense at the same time like it was all carefully planned from the beginning. You can tell it was all carefully constructed, each episode and every scene feeling necessary to push the plot forward.

The character development in season 4 is absolutely amazing. Eren goes from a sort of generic, kind of annoying character to one of the best protagonists we’ve seen in recent anime memory. His change seems shocking but also not out of character, it makes sense how he would develop into this which makes it all the more incredible to see his evolution. We see Reiner sink even further into despair, he struggles to hold on, sometimes wanting to give in but also realizing he still has to fight to protect his homeland and the ones he cares about. Any hate you had for him will disappear and instead be replaced with sympathy even though he is the enemy. Reiner’s development brings him up from being one of the better Attack on Titan characters to one of the best characters in the entire show. The last character I specifically want to talk about is Zeke, he was solely just a good villain in the previous season but season 4 has elevated him to a great character. Before we thought he was just a smart evil guy, you probably hated him for what he did, but again, just like with Reiner your hatred will be replaced with sympathy. We finally learn the reasons behind his motives and what his past was like. We learn he is a much more deep and complex character than simply a bad guy from the other side of the ocean. 

The new characters introduced in this season are some of the best in the show. They are mostly all from the enemy side with some from other land but they aren’t painted in an evil light. The way they show these characters really harkens back to season one during the training arc when we were introduced to the gang. They are each carefully crafted with their own personality, backstories, and motives that will knock you out of the thought “they are the enemy”. You will instantly love them and come to care about their well-being almost as much as the main crew. Among some of my favorite new characters are Gabi, Yelena, Pieck, and Magath as I feel they all perfectly embody the thoughts, feelings, and diversity of the people on the other side of the ocean. When they inevitably clash with our main crew you aren’t going to root for them, but you also won’t root against them, you’ll just be hoping that they make it out alive.  

Lastly, I want to talk about the art style, animation, and action all in one. The art style of the season is a big change from previous seasons. The art style is almost a complete 1 to 1 with the manga. I personally like this change because the art style on the current Attack on Titan manga is actually pretty good unlike most of the art from the past manga which the previous studio was adapting from. Also, as a manga reader, I like it because it feels more like Attack on Titan than the previous art style, plus they mostly improve on the sketchy or confusing art that Isayama still occasionally had. The animation is also pretty good, characters move smoothly which allows the scenes to do the same. The CGI used while not as good as traditional 2D animation it is still the best CGI I have ever seen in an anime. They do a really good job of blending the CGI with the 2D animation and sometimes you won’t even notice that they’re using CGI. All of these elements do help when there is action on the screen. While you may be disappointed that there isn’t as much action as previous seasons or that it looks as good as previous seasons, the parts where there is action are some of the best action in the series and it all looks pretty good. 

The opening and ending songs for this season are some of if not the best in the series. Both songs perfectly match the tone that the anime sets. You'll never have that complaint where the ending is either too happy or too sad compared to the episode, it fits every episode perfectly. The voice acting is also stellar, each characters' voice fits them perfectly, and each voice actor does a tremendous job getting the emotions of their characters off. Eren's voice actor in particular is an absolute stand-out. He somehow elevated his performance to a higher level. The OSTs are still amazing like in previous seasons, they really help bring out the emotion and enhance the tension and epicness of the scenes.  

My closing thoughts with this review are as follows, this is my personal favorite season of Attack on Titan. It really felt like the manga was coming alive this season. It’s to the point where I question if I should go back to the manga since I have the anime. It adds so many things that the manga just couldn’t convey as well. Any emotions I felt while reading the manga were enhanced for the anime, any confusions or questions I had while reading the manga were answered through the anime. This season only strengthened my position of having Attack on Titan as my favorite anime of all time. If you’ve watched all of the previous seasons but not this one I implore you to watch it, if you haven’t watched any Attack on Titan I also implore you to watch the whole series. Lastly, if you must absolutely know what's going to happen next then I recommend reading the manga, it's amazing.

That’s more or less all I have to say, thanks for reading, and see you for season 2.",2021-03-28T16:48:00+00:00,10
"This season of Attack on titan wasn't anything I expected. It surprised the hell out me, just seeing how the show built up to where it is now made me feel grateful at the fact that I am alive to see it and the hype the show gets is understandable.*Story: 10*AOT's story is something that feels like whatever you saw and were mentioned in the previous seasons are things that you shouldn't forget because everything that was said is important and everything feels like it is connected in some way and this season does well explaining things in the show that left us with questionsfrom the previous seasons. I feel that there are still more secrets to be revealed in Part 2.


*Art: 9*


That art in this season was great with showing the emotions of characters. Whenever there's was a tense situation you could see their desperation or when some of the characters were lying you wouldn't be able tell and the CGI the Titans were extremely  good and I feel like Mappa's CGI has been improving over the years and this probably one their best but there were times when the animation was a bit questionable, some scenes felt a bit awkward or the character designs were a bit inconsistent but at the end of the day you forget about all of that.


*Sound: 10*


Honestly this seasons OST's were hype as usual and The OP always got me pumped to watch a episode, the ED always gave me the feeling of sadness knowing that I have to wait for a week for a new episode, the more I listened to them the more I enjoyed it and every time the music kicked in during a episode it always set the right f mood for that certain moment but I am kind of disappointed at the fact that they didn't  add some of the old OSTs


*Character: 9* 


This season showed how events from the previous season affected the characters and the way they act now. I found it very interesting how some characters deaths really affected the rest the characters in this season and seeing how it changed them was really cool but also sad because most of the characters aren't the same as they were from the previous seasons. The voice actors were outstanding with speaking according how the characters were feeling and also the energy drive they put into the characters was amazing. The downside is that some of the old characters are kind of left out this season and that was a bit of a downside this season but there are new characters who are introduced in this season  who are really interesting.


*Enjoyment: 10*


My enjoyment level was pretty because I watched it weekly and that feeling of wondering what's going to happen in the next episode got me excited. I suggest you just watch the show in one setting(If you can) because in all honesty it' painful to wait for an episode to come out.


*Overall: 10* 

I really enjoyed this season and I think it's probably the best season of this show so far, in my opinion. The dialogue, the voice acting, the art, the story and the sound  were great that it always kept me hooked and I highly recommend that you watch this season of Attack on Titan of haven't watched it yet",2021-03-28T15:35:00+00:00,10
"I always have to be kind of objective when rating AoT seasons because I don't like AoT that much, but this is the first season where I feel like my rating is accurate. I'm not gonna spend a whole lot of time talking about this season, but I'll share my thoughts on the changes that've happened between the last season and this final season.So, I haven't read the manga; I've got no prior context to what's going on in this season, but it was *weird.* I don't know what I thought would happen after last season, but what you get in these 16 episodes wasnot it. That being said, I thought it was *super* cool. I don't know that the story was laid out as well as it could've been in the beginning of the season, but the way the story unfolded was done really well. The way the story divided itself up between characters, present day and flashback, action and exposition, etc., made it feel a lot smoother to watch than previous seasons.

Again, I don't have any manga context, so seeing what was done with the characters this season was extremely interesting. I don't usually care for individual characters in AoT as much as I pay attention to the story, but I even found the new characters to be intriguing this season, along with the main characters--probably because so much has changed for these characters. The seiyuu did an amazing job, as well. I mean, AoT already has intense scenes all over the place, but because this season was so different, I thought the seiyuu pulled off the tonal shift really well.

Besides that, I'm actually excited to see where the story goes because I think, with the way things are headed, there's a good ended on the way. I'm enjoying AoT for once, so hopefully I'll stay just as excited for the next half as I was for this one.",2021-03-28T15:28:00+00:00,9
"Well that was sure quite a journey to watch the large amount of serious things that have been unfolded in this anime. At first like anyone else who has watched the show for a long while, I was hesitant that WIT studio decided to drop the series considering it was one of their first anime’s ever made! However as you really watched the whole thing, you will get use to how it looks way darker than previous seasons and of course, it is darker! You get to see Eren becoming a man but with bad intentions. You first get to meet new characters that youwouldn’t have a clue about it until you get to know them throughout the whole season. I really liked the opening like “My War” represented the shows theme so darn well! 

Now the only reason why I didn’t rate this a 9 or a 10 like other people have because it’s obviously not finished (WINTER 2022 WHY?!). However you gotta praise hugely to MAPPA for showing us this anime when WIT gave up on it! Definitely this part 1 of the final season is worth the watch if you are into the series so far!",2021-03-28T14:24:00+00:00,8
"I never thought I'd be here again.I first started watching Attack on Titan when I was 15 and there was nothing but the first season and the manga to go off of. As I waited for the second season to come out, I eventually lost interest as the years went by. 'It had been too long and the momentum was gone,' I thought. Until now.In the expanse of three days, I watched roughly forty episodes of this insanity and now I can't stop thinking about it. Attack on Titan, I originally thought, was nothing more than a more gritty example of a typical Shounen anime.I couldn't be more wrong.
In the following seasons, it has turned from a hack and slash gorefest into a political thriller that depicts the horrors of war. The Titans are no longer the focal point- they are no longer the enemy. They are just a vessel for them. 
I have never been more stressed out to watch a show. It's great. I'm suffering. Please stop killing all my favourite characters.",2021-03-23T16:40:00+00:00,9
"I mean attack on titan needs no introduction its overhyped and overated as shit, but still a great series. I wouldnt even call it top 5 shounen animanga to be fair full metal, ruruni kenshin, gintama, gto, beastars manga, aku no hana, hxh, and ashita no joe take the crown from it, but this review isnt about those series its about attack on titanStory: 8AHH yes a very intriguing story i like very captivating though it relies on some shock factor and eh correlation with dynamics at some times. Gabi is a great character yet they take her possible defying moments and splits it betweenfalcon which just confuses me. The plot structure is unique but the premise is boring we've seen multiple series with utilitarianism and determinism as their main themes but attack on titan just made a twist with it. Ignoring all the flaws still a well thought out story

characters 8: falco, zeke, reiner, eren, gabi, floch steal the show all amazing characters but lack of spread with the other dynamics and structure of characters. The plot is great but with some amazing and lifeless characters almost as if they dont exist


art and music: 7/10
it ok i guess


enjoyment: 7/10 
sure its cool",2021-03-23T08:45:00+00:00,8
"""That day, when the wall was destroyed and Titans invaded my hometown, I watched my mom get eaten. I couldn't understand...Why was my mom eaten by a Titan?""I've rewatched this series twice and it still hits the same every time. Coming from your typical die-hard AOT fan, this review may just be something you happened to read and you may end up forgetting it. If you enjoy thought-provoking shows, shows with amazing lore, shows that keep you on the edge of your seat, Attack on Titan is the one for you. If you're hesitating to watch it, just go for it. The rest of thisreview isn't going to be formal; I'm just adding my review of AOT to MAL for myself. A bit of a self-reflection per se. (No spoilers).

Many AOT viewers go into Attack on Titan first thinking it's just a show about killing titans. Action. Suspense. The expected. You cannot be more wrong. The story itself goes so much in-depth with universal issues, whether it is revenge, betrayal, trust, freedom, or hate. These themes are respectively covered throughout all four seasons. 

And these four seasons have been such a rollercoaster. I am currently an anime-only watcher, meaning I have not touched the AOT manga at all. However, considering the fact that part 2 of this final season is airing Winter of 2022, I thought it would be smart for me to read the manga before anything is spoiled for me in the span of time I await the second part. So yea! I shall get to that soon.

""Attack on Titan is a modern masterpiece.
Attack on Titan has the best story.
...is so well-written
...so well thought out
...has the best plot.""

If you've been reading up on other AOT reviews, these are some very common claims you may have seen regarding this show. Vague? A bit. But all I have to say is I agree. If you're a regular shounen watcher, you understand that action anime are split up into separate arcs. The main ""arcs"" are the seasons. In the first season, Eren is fueled by rage. In the next, he is fueled by betrayal.
Then the crave for freedom.
And at last, the last season—hatred.

Even if you aren't one to watch for the plot, the characters in AOT are all so well-written. Attack on Titan was such a ride. You might love all the characters. You might end up hating all of them. One indisputable fact is that they are all well-written. Eren, the main character, goes through so much these four seasons. The relationships between him and his friends are distinct, but above all, the relationships among his group of friends are easy to remember. They all have their own story and are all memorable in their own way. The characters feel real. 

Contrary to popular belief, I didn't HATE the new animation. As wild as the fandom went regarding Mikasa's new look, her short hair fit the manga's image of her well. I do personally think the WIT fight animations were more intense and engaging than the animation done at MAPPA for this final season. I hope this changes next winter (2022), when part two is released. Despite this show displaying anti-fascism, I've seen some AOT fans on the internet claim contradicting political claims about the show. But that's a whole different conversation.

The soundtrack for AOT is dramatic. But it is so good. SO good. This show is amazing. Trust.

TL;DR: Attack on Titan is an amazing series. With an awfully good story, amazing art, legendary soundtrack, complex/real characters, this show is the whole package. Watch the first season at least.",2021-03-19T09:06:00+00:00,10
"wow another 10 review from a fan boi, who gives a shit, right?now i wouldn't call myself a fan boi of this series, i remember when i first watched the first season i thought this is an emotional and fun action anime but there isn't much of a meaning in this anime, just enjoy the action and watch people getting eaten by the titans is all this anime has to offerit took me until this season to admit there is something more than that in attack on titan as a wholeCharacters:let's just appreciate how much they have changed and how real most of them feellike,

Levi:
in season 1 and 2 i never understood the hype around him, why is he so popular?? is it his eyes? is it his skillful use of anti-titan devices?? is it his alpha male behavior? or is it his OCD? it can't be his height that's for sure!
but then i watch his background and how he was a thief and how Erwin changed him, and how Levi joined the army not because to save humanity or something like that but because of his fascination with Erwin, i specially love when his comrades turn into titans and the cold look in his eyes while he is falling, showing his frustration of losing his comrades again
just the fact that how a bad person like him turned into one of the few hope humanity have is fascinating to me

Eren:
i don't think anyone particularly liked him before this season, he gave the same vibe as Naruto to me only more angry and impulsive, besides his hatred for titans nothing was going on with him but this season turned him way more interesting, we still don't know the reason behind his actions but Jesus Christ does he look like a total badass, did you see how he punched Armin? that was so fucking cool, Eren has lost his impulsiveness and the fact that he doesn't hate titans anymore is amazing to me

Reiner:
this guy is a little underrated, nobody told him he has been brainwashed by the state, he realized it on his own and the guilt of killing """"so called absolute evils"" has been killing him for years

Armin and Mikasa:
i do believe these two didn't get the depth they deserve, don't get me wrong their development is great but they didn't reach their potentials


story:
one of the thing that i ABSOLUTELY love about this season in particular is the fact that there are scenes less than 5 seconds but you could only understand the depth of it if you know the suffering the characters have gone through, for example the scene where that titan is in total disbelief on why the fuck humans instead of running away, are coming to kill him!
it kinda reminded me of how ants attack bigger animals, the fact that humans had to adapt to fight the fucking titans is so tragic, and it is in that moment when they are trying to hunt the confused titan that you can see how much suffering they have gone through to be as skillful as they are
i love the plot, it's amazing

soundtrack and opening:
the opening song isn't good tbh, and the ending song didn't give the usual vibe we got from AOT previously, at first i didn't like the ending song but after episode 3 the ending song suddenly became a lot more interesting and understandable, it's now in my favorite song lists

the soundtracks are astonishing, fucking AMAZING

Art:
look the art is really great, i truly love it but there are scenes where it really is bad, i think it's the CGI thing, i didn't like those moments when titans are looking so weird and glowy! but the other scenes are masterpiece 8/10

conclusion:
definitely a must watch",2021-03-19T06:34:00+00:00,10
"The final season of Attack on titan does many things right. It takes the suspense, mystery, world building, characters and everything we love about the previous seasons and makes them better. Each episode makes you feel a wide range of emotions and leaves you wanting for more at the end.I haven't been more invested in any series before this one and this season has intensified my love for Attack on Titan.The plot revolves around Eren's want for revenge and it does so magnificently. A lot has changed since the first season and story has come a full circle from the inhabitants of walls being eatento the ones eating. The enemy has been clearly established in the previous seasons however this season tries to bring out the viewer's sympathy for them. All in all, the stakes are higher than ever before and the action scenes (there are  many) have been done justice by the animation studio.

Every episode is better than the previous and even the first episode blew my expectations out of the water.

I can't wait to see how this series ends and I am sure it will go down as one of the best anime ever made.",2021-03-06T07:48:00+00:00,10
"Anime like Attack on Titan only come around once in an era, and the final season of this modern-day classic is not disappointing. In fact, it's shaping up to be one of the best final seasons I've ever seen. Please do not read this review if you haven't seen seasons 1-3. There are also some very minor spoilers for the new season. You've been warned, now let's get on with it:Story (10): My favorite parts of Attack on Titan are always the ""calm before the storm"" moments, and that's exactly how this season starts out. Right after the battle with the Mid-East Alliance, we getto witness the lives of the oppressed Eldians living in Marley, as opposed to the Eldians in Paradis we have seen in all the other seasons. We are introduced to the Warrior Candidates who could inherit Armor after Reiner's term is up: Gabi, Falco, Udo, and Zofia. On top of that, we learn more about the lives and living conditions of the current Warriors: Reiner (Armor), Zeke (Beast), Porco (Jaw), and Pieck (Cart), as well as those of all the other oppressed Eldians under Marley's rule. By finding this out, the world becomes greyer and greyer, and by the time things got ugly between the two sides, I was completely torn on whose side I wanted to be on. Despite having followed the Survey Corps and Paradisians for 3 seasons, I found myself not wanting them to win this conflict. Well, that's a bit of an exaggeration, I still wanted them to win, but I didn't want them to do so at the expense of the Warrior Unit and Marleyan Eldians, because it is made clear that they are victims too. It was a genius narrative decision on their part. Never have I cared so much about characters after only 3-4 episodes as much as those I cared about for 3 seasons.

Art (10): This season is beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Anyone hating on Studio MAPPA for their decision to use CGI for the titans- BARELY NOTICEABLE CGI, MIGHT I ADD- is not a real fan of Attack on Titan. You guys have clearly never seen Berserk 2016 if you're so offended by the use of CGI, imagine how Berserk fans felt. Don't make yourselves out to be victims of some horrible crime, you're just making yourself look stupid. This is easily some of the best CGI I've ever seen in an anime, with only ufotable productions like Demon Slayer above it. The production and animation crew poured their blood, sweat, and tears into this season, and it really shows. Thank you MAPPA for giving us this season when no one else was willing to step up after WIT. As for character designs, perfection. Eren's new look is exactly like how I imagined him, Levi looks even hotter than he did in the last seasons (which I didn't know was possible), Mikasa is prettier than ever before (so stop misgendering her, please stop, you're embarrassing yourself and the fandom), and especially Pieck's design was nailed. She was so cute in the manga, and now she's even cuter in the anime! Although I miss WIT, I certainly don't miss their CGI. I have no choice but to give this a 10/10, sorry not sorry MAPPA haters.

Sound (10): I sing the new opening every single week, it's that good! The ending is also awesome, and for the first time since Love Live! Sunshine!! season 2, I'm actually watching the ending when the episode is done. The soundtrack choices were spot-on too, and when they started playing YOUSEEBIGGIRL in episode 4, I actually almost screamed! As much as I love that song though, it did not fit the mood of Declaration of War (which is when everyone freaked out about them not playing it), and I'm happy with their choice for that scene. In terms of voice acting, Kaji Yuki is still the best actor, but Sakura Ayane is quickly rising to the top! Seriously, the amount of emotion that has gone into this performance has made Gabi even more of a compelling character than she would have been otherwise. Her ""Reiner"" scream from Assault gave me goose bumps!

Characters (11): Okay, HOW DO THE CHARACTERS JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER AND BETTER?! Eren, despite what's going on with him right now, has proven himself to be one of the best written protagonists... ever. I disagree with his character this season, but I can't deny how awesome his character development is, and how much fun he is to watch. Meanwhile, Mikasa continues to prove herself as one of the best characters in the story with some serious development just starting (only those who have obsessively analyzed her for 3 seasons before this can appreciate how great she really is beneath the surface), Hange has made a surprising rise to the top as well, and most of all, this season kind of revealed how little we knew about Reiner and his past, so it was great to see him get some spotlight. As for the new characters, Porco was one of my favorites, just because of how much he seems like a real guy I would meet somewhere. Falco and Gabi serve as the parallels for Eren and Mikasa, yet they manage to be their own people as well. For example, Falco has Mikasa's protective nature and someone he wants to protect, but unlike her, he doesn't really have the skills to back this up, and he has Eren's distrust of the government as well as Armin's logic. Gabi has Eren's temper and desire for revenge, but with a mix of Mikasa's skills and Armin's battle genius, a mix of Eren and Sasha's personality, Levi's pettiness, and she's got about as many loose screws as Hange (not quite on the Eren/Erwin level). Both Falco and Gabi are quickly rising as my favorite characters other than Mikasa just because of how well the story presents them to us. Falco and Gabi start out with as much hatred for Paradis, but based on their experiences, their views change drastically in different ways. Gabi in particular is the perfect representation of a brainwashed child soldier from Marley, and her character development has been the most entertaining (yet also kind of annoying because you wish it would just be unrealistic and have her side with the heroes immediately) and depressing things in this new season. As far as we've seen, every character has had some time to shine this season with the possible exception of Connie, and don't worry, if everyone is getting something, he'll be up soon.

Enjoyment (20000): I LOVE this new season. In case you couldn't tell by my lack of vocabulary, I thinks it's awesome and by far the best season of Attack on Titan we've had, and I was starting to urn out of words to talk about how great it was. Anyway... go watch it! Right now!",2021-03-05T11:07:00+00:00,10
"The Final Season is probably the most anticipated anime of our time. A lot was said about MAPPA studios being in charge of a project this big and in all honesty, they did not disappoint. The story so far sticks to the details of the manga. So there's absolutely no debate that the story is a 10/10. Some fans made remarks regarding how some scenes of the animations used CGI. I personally have no problem with it. All the other aspects of the anime is just as good as the previous season, if not even better. The Final Season feels so much more clean, witha more modern taste in animation. Just like the manga, there aren't as many fighting and gliding scenes coming, except at the very end. But even then, it doesn't change the fact that The Final Season is just as engaging, even without Levi or Mikasa slashing and making havoc.",2021-03-03T05:54:00+00:00,10
"PPL always says Aot isn't that great, but the story is so perfect that it's hard to imagine Isayama finishing it in 10 years and honing it into a modern masterpiece. This is all the more admirable considering that he was serialized as Manga. Returning to the work itself, MAPPA has faithfully restored the original work over the Manga cut by Wit studio, bringing the climax of the entire Aot story in such a short period of time, and many are unhappy with the frequent use of CGI, but considering all the objective factors, these problems can be fully understood and accepted. In fact, morepeople are just not used to the change of style from Wit to Mappa, and have higher expectations for the original work itself, view season 4 anime with such hostility, however, no matter how the anime section is handled, Isayama's narrative is perfect, trust him when you immerse yourself in the story, when you mourn the transformation and behavior of one of the characters in the story, you find yourself falling in love with the work. In addition, I can understand why wit won't take over the final season, because the story in the first three seasons is the islanders continuously declassified process, black and white confrontation, the good and evil side is obvious, for Wit Studio's adaptation Manga, but the final season is nothing like this one, which brings the two sides into a gray area and puts the whole thing in God's eyes, compared to the last three seasons, the contradiction itself becomes a more revealing point, and MAPPA's realistic and nuanced style may amplify this better than wit.",2021-02-26T20:24:00+00:00,10
"Not having watched the series before and seeing that the final season is currently airing I decided to binged 69 episodes in 5 days just to get caught upThis season didn't had a good start for me since the sudden change turned me off I just ended up having to skip and fast forward some scenes I just didn't cared about like the new characters. Thankfully after a few episodes later it got back on track with that attack on Marley which I really enjoyed. The CG is mostly acceptable, though they are a lot more noticeable now than previous seasons. The opening is myfavorite by far since it captures this season's focus on war

So yeah promising story so far though I don't really care about these new kids which I'm afraid they are gonna focus on more

this is the first time I've written a review",2021-02-21T07:25:00+00:00,8
"The new attack on titan is a spectacular story and is strong and powerful then the other seasons. This last season attack on titan has a lot more action and amazing scenes and I love the story more then ever. Compared to some of the old and long going animes I think this one has a delivered really well in terms of story and keeping the surrealism and keeping character development throughout the entire series, the 3 stages of grief the main character goes through which is very powerful. This has such great art style with so much detail in the characters faces and uniqueart style then most animes. They keep the characters recognizable then most animes too. I enjoy the complexity of the story but since there are gaps between each season like a year or 2 it can be kind of confusing however it still easy to grasp the story regardless. The audio is great the opening songs are wonderful and rememberable as well as great ending songs. The audio with the theme song throughout the last season, it has this surreal feeling as it creates a great atmosphere. The ideas are really powerful and the anime does not seem to run out of ideas which is really great. I have for the longest time watching anime enjoy this anime the most out of any other anime in my entire life, it's got action it's got the best characters, it's so hard to create characters and especially for multiple characters in one anime alone and this one has managed to keep almost every character in sync, and smooth natural state. 

Story 10/10
Great story, the story is very complex and is still very powerful and i love it very much
Art 10/10
unique dark surreal look to the entire anime and looks amazing especially the characters.
Character 10/10
The characters are amazing and the development keeps me watching as its very compelling and 
you become very attached to each and every character as they are the key and every character are 
important not just the main character.
Enjoyment 10/10
The anime always keeps me on the seat every step of the way of the entire anime

This anime has been such a blast watching and despite having all the anime in the world I think this one is unique and very out of the ordinary then some anime out there I hope you get to watch this anime and enjoy the anime for what it is, as a masterpiece. You should start watching this anime from the first season if you have not watched the anime at all. For people that have dropped the anime because the other season they feel didn't do well for them and don't want to watch the final season because of that, I would go watch the final season as it is just so good and should give the anime another shot its just too good.",2021-02-18T13:54:00+00:00,10
So aot the story is REALLY nice 10/10 Than we have the art/animation the art and animation is really good but it's not as good as the old seasons so that's pretty sad but it's still really niceThan we have the sound design it's really niceThan the charecters they are really nice and they kinda feel like reall people for example eren is really nice in this season he kinda got something like a trauma well it's not that but you get it so i give charecters a 10 i think you know whyAnd overall enjoyment ofcourse 10! If your looking for anime and watchedthe other season YOU SHOULD DEFINETLY WATCH THIS this anime IS A 10 it is SO GOOD so yeah you should give it a watch NOW,2021-02-10T22:11:00+00:00,10
"So far, I'm loving the manga adaptation of this series. Everything is going smoothly, the foreshadowing, OST, the thrill and excitement are all there.Also, the voice actors are doing great for this final season. I trust the staffs of mappa in pulling this one out as one of the best Anime ever. The storytelling is just so good. A lot won't like this but IMO this is the best show that I've watched so far. This review is based on my opinion so for the other users, please take this with a grain of salt. Re-watching the series helps me learn new more things.",2021-02-09T16:09:00+00:00,10
"This anime is simply a masterpiece, it's the best show I have ever seen with no comparison.The plot has no holes, the character development is insanely good.Numerous Iconic scenes.I LOVE IT!!!The contrast between point of views, the idea that misunderstanding between people is what leads to all conflict is shown impressively.The fights between titans are pretty cool and not just action it contains strategy and creativity you won't find anywhere else.It differ than any anime or movie I ever watched Shineki no Kyogin is in a league of its own.The opening song is also very suitable in my opinion with the war atmosphere that willoccur later in the season finale, where people don't even like the reason that the opening filler is not linked Horzon, but in my opinion it doesn't matter",2021-02-09T14:42:00+00:00,10
"For a story to be a masterpiece, I think it has to be relevant. Even after its aired and finally it has to mean something, and I believe Attack on titan achieves this, the story evolves into what can be called a race war, two things that will always be relevant, war and racial struggles and Attack on titan delivers on telling a compelling story with nuance and doesn't hold back. I praise it for its honest portrayal of war and how there truly is no good or bad, there are simply imperfect people expected to be perfect in imperfect situations.The story is at anall time high, all out titan war and it's edging closer to its conclusion, the visuals are stunning, the animation is solid and the sound design and score its hard. 

The story is worthy of its accliam and your watch time.

"Accept or not we are withnessing a classic now. This seris will be very well known in the future and it's world building is definetly greater than FMAB's   Alright this is basicly shows us what happens after they reached the ocean. They are learning that they were not only humans on the planet and etc. But great way of this series is that nations are bassed on real nations on the world. (Marley is clearly Germany) and it has acctual politics which matters. I am not going to spoil manga but things are just begining now.       Sostory and worldbuilding are great but since it's an Anime we must also look at the art. I mean it's not bad but previpus seasons was much much better. I understand since story is dark they made it bit more gray in certain ways but still CGI would be better. its 7/10 on my book

  Characters are great. People hate Gabi but she is so similar to Eren and what she does is literally based on my book.

  Overall I am enjoying it so far and I belive that this season will be one of the classics in the future and we wil lall remember it with a smile when we are old",2021-02-07T03:16:00+00:00,9
"Attack on titan is by far the best anime of all time. No other anime can even light a candle next to aot. The story is abseloutley brilliant and fascinating. The lore of the story captures you and the suspense keeps you engaged in the story. The plot twists are insane. The foreshadowing is also insane. Attack on titan is objectively the best written anime of all time no discussion. In addition, the animation is so clean an amazing. The music is so good it perfectly captures the atmosphere of the anime. The characters are perfectly written. They are realistic and interesting and have greatdevelopment. Overall this anime does everything perfect it does not have a single flaw. There is also no fanservice which makes the anime even better.",2021-02-06T22:44:00+00:00,10
"AOT has been a huge part of my teenage life; I've been hooked since the age of 13. I am now 18 and the manga is projected to end in two months :(It has honestly been an insane ride since Chapter 1, it is completely in another league from the other shows I've seen. Lovable and relatable characters who undergo a lot of development, beautiful art and depiction of scenes from the manga, and the soundtrack speaks for itself. There is something for everyone to enjoy in Attack On Titan - from fight scenes, emotional moments, and humour whenever it is appropriate. It only missesRomance, but who cares because romance does not at all synchronize with this show's plot. 

I cannot wait to see how Isayama chooses to end this crazy journey.",2021-02-05T06:11:00+00:00,10
"The story: This is one of my favourite animes. I remember, when I whatched first the AoT, I didn't sleep too much, because I wanted to watch the next episodes, more and more. And now I'm reading the manga, but I can't wait to see the next episode. A very interesting story, with very much lesson. This arc is a bit different, than the other, but still good. We can see the other side, we can see a big paralellism between the AoT and the reality. We can learn, that it's not just black and white, doesn't exist the good and the bad like wethought. Every people has family, dreams, everybody wants a better future. So it's amazing, and it's a difficult story.

The art: Still I didn't like the MAPPA's art, especially the CGI titans, and the ODM gear. Still it's a bit strange, but not bad. 

The sound: It was weird, that during the battle scenes we didn't hear any music, just some sword slashing, some gun, and the ODM gear. And when somebody dies, I wait for a sad music, not an... idk what. 

The characters: I'm still hateing Floch, and also I hate Yelena. Gabi is a bit annying, but I like her. It's very interesting how much Eren and some other character changed, while the others didn't changed.

The enjoyment: Like I said, I really love this anime, the art and the sound make me a bit disappointed, but I enjoy the anime at all.

(Sorry for my bad english, I'm still learning)",2021-02-05T04:46:00+00:00,9
"Before I write anything else, I should say that I haven't read the manga and that the cgi is absolutely awful.Story (8): The story as a whole has been pretty good so far. My only complaint is that there isn't really any driving force for the character's actions other than the Paradis gang wanting to defeat Marley and vice versa. There isn't much depth (yet) but I'm excited to see where the story is going.Art (3): I don't think there is anything more disappointing about this show so far than the art. I was nervous that the animation was going from WIT to Mappa butI had confidence in Mappa to deliver. I mean, I was watching Jujutsu Kaisen and that animation is pretty dang good. I will be honest, I didn't realize that the 1st episode was mostly cgi. I think the art style that they use covered it up pretty well. Going into episode 5 (?) I was really excited for what the anime would bring when the fights eventually came. But holy mother of mercy was I disappointed. So much of the fights are cgi that it just looks awful. There have been times when watching the most recent episodes where I had to give up watching for a bit because the cgi was so painfully obvious and terrible. Don't believe me? The worst so far has been in episode 7. About 4:30 in there is a 20 second longshot that is literally entirely cgi. Watch that section then tell me the animation is a 10. When people say that they don't notice it I have to laugh because it is so awful and obvious that anyone with eyes should be able to recognize how bad it gets. And before people say that the cgi isn't that bad, they're right. It is better than what WIT used for the Colossal Titan, but that's just it. WIT's cgi was used on just the Colossal Titan and occasionally interspersed throughout the anime to pretty certain things up. Mappa is throwing its cgi on anything that moves. I can understand using cgi on the titans (although I wouldn't like it and you see from the trailers how good they can be in 2D), but using it on a majority of the humans is where I draw the line.

Sound (9): Not much to say here. The ost is a banger just like the previous seasons, but there are some odd choices here and there for tracks, which is why it's a 9. 

Character (10): The characters are currently carrying the entire season right now. I mentioned before how the plot doesn't have much depth (yet) so the duty falls on the characters to provide an interesting story, and so far they have been doing great on that front. Reiner has been so interesting and that is really what is causing me to continue watching.

Enjoyment (6): Practically everything else about the show so far has been great but the animation...it single-handedly brings down my enjoyment.

Overall/final thoughts (7): I want Attack on Titan to be good. From what I've heard from manga readers it only gets better and better, but the animation is so disappointing that it is ruining not only my enjoyment but many others as well. I should mention that I don't condone AOT fanboys harassing the animators but on the other side the Mappa fanboys are pointing to those few that are harassing and using that as an excuse to disregard the valid point that the animation is trash. I loved Season 3 part 2. It is one of my favorite anime seasons ever, and the fact that this is what comes after is disheartening. Then you remember that the anime will likely never be re-animated and that this is the one shot to truly adapt this masterpiece. I'm glad that season 4 is being made, but I would've preferred waiting 3-4 months extra if it meant getting the incredible animation of the first 3 seasons. If this garbage animation continues I might drop the series. What a disappointment.",2021-02-04T15:42:00+00:00,7
"this review has spoilers from [1-3 seasons] of attack on titian and a light and little spoilers from season 4 episode 1 only so aware of that before reading this review and for tyhose who didn't see attack on titian season 4[final season] i think its a 10\10.[Spoiler Alert] [1-3] seasons[first episode of season 4]the story: it's continues after a while from our original story and one of the best thing that this story does is transition from our setting that were so familiar which is [paradise island] and surprisingly it happens smoothly and it makes for great and exciting events. this story has ofplot twists, mysteries, fights, hype and character develpoment that honestly no show that I watched was able to do it in the same amount of time, episodes or chapters.this story is one of the best stories without a doubt in the history of anime.story10\10

art: the art and animation of characters is great same for everything in this show other than the Titians they are not terrible but that doesn't make them good  and i understand the pressure that mappa was under because of time problems but that doesn't make the titian animation good but it's definitely better than majority of CGI in the anime industry and ''it is what it is''. art 8\10


sound: soundtracks are great that is all it is. sounds 9\10

characters: they have a lot of development and progression and the best things about these characters is that you know them from the very beginning and you see their best moments and their last moments and their badass moments and how they change, teamwork is one of this show best parts. characters 10\10


overall: I enjoyed this show in all the departments it's a masterpiece that has some flaws but you forgive them because the flaws are little and the highs are UNCOUNTABLE . overall 10/10",2021-02-02T09:14:00+00:00,10
"absolutely amazing: a splendid execution of what the manga outlined.even though this was made within the very short time span of 1 year, even when titan fights are almost all cgi, it isnt even that bad to look at, and might even be the first recorded instance of actually good and appropriate use of cgi in any anime.the show also compensates for the use of cgi in many ways: like the lighting and color choices of scenes in the attack on liberio arc, the sound design that really made everything more stark, as well as the seamless change in art style that really changed thetone of the show.

compounded with the already amazing and intricate plot the show has, hands down 10.",2021-02-01T04:13:00+00:00,10
"yeaa its already episode 7 and they kinda disapoinment me specially at episode 6&7 but,its still a very good showstorylets talk about the story,soo far the story hits diffrent then the other season,its more dark and talk more about what is freedom,what you must takes when you want freedom,at this anime eren take many responsibility of killingkilling human specially on episode 6.yeahh its a deep story 9/10artfor art i will seprate cgi and hand drawingcgithe cgi is kinda inconsistent some of them are mehhh some of them are wowwexemple for ""mehhh"" cgi is when eren cut off the war hammer body from the core (episode6)
exemple for ""woww"" cgi is jaw titan and armored titan (episdoe 1)
(7/10)
hand drawing
because they make almost all titan scene is cgi soo the take more time for hand drawing i think they focused on story more than the action,because of that they did a great job expression chara on hand drwing animation is great you can tell how scared tybur is and how depressed reiner is
edit,after watch episode 8 i can really tell that the hand drawing animation is focused on expression of a character and the story soo they make detailed hand drawing animation
(9/10)
because of that i give the art 8/10

sound
over all almost all sound at aot final season its great but there is one think that sound soo bad and its at episode 6 when eren cut off war hammer titan from the core its like cheap sound effect
soo because of that i give the sound 8/10

character
at this season the chara fells diffrent then the other seoson the chara is complicated to say.
i give the character 9/10

enjoyment
i kinda enjoed this anime but because of some scene some sound its kinda make my enjoyment ruined specially for episode 6
soo i give it 7/10
edit after watch episode 8
after watch episode 8 this anime fells more enjoyble

overall
aot is still a very good show its still make me exited,and make me impressed at some scene,even though there is some scene that ruined my enjoymend
soo because of that i give atack on titan final season (from episode 1-8) 8.4/10




i heard that they gonna make aot final season whith 2 more part (part 2 and 3)
i hope thats was true :)",2021-01-31T18:49:00+00:00,8
"*Spoiler warning!*(I already reviewed this season when it started, but I'm re-doing my review because it wasn't accurate to my current opinions on the season. Also, I feel like back then I based my opinions somewhat on previous seasons, which I don't like doing.)Story/plot 6/10 - The plot was good, don't get me wrong. But I feel like certain moments/episodes were either way too slow paced, or too fast paced. For example, episode 1, while it was a introduction to new characters, I feel like it was way too slow paced, we learned so little about each of the new warrior cadets in the firstepisode, even though it was mostly centered on them. Meanwhile, when it comes to certain characters like Zofia and Udo, there deaths came almost immediately when the fight started (I'm referring to Eren vs Warhammer Titan.), I feel like we should've saw more of them, so then maybe when they died we could've actually felt sad about it. Besides the pacing, I feel like the story was fine, but I preferred the story in the first 3 seasons more then this season.

Art/Animation 9/10 - But, I will say the art and animation this season was beautiful! The last 3 seasons were fine but some of the parts in the manga were altered in the anime, and I'm not saying that's bad, but I feel like it would've been better to animate the scenes accurately to the manga panels.
Also, the CGI this season was surprisingly good, and the color pallet for specific scenes were very fitting. Art was also spectacular, I feel like each scene was very detailed and just great too look at!

Sound 6/10 - Sound is the same as any other anime. I do love both the dub and sub voice actors for most characters though!

Characters/personalities 7/10 - Most of the old characters personalities stayed the same. But, I feel like Eren and Armin definitely changed personality wise. I feel like Armin used to be very kind towards most people he knew, and he avoided killing people as much as possible. But, in season 4 it seems like he just threw that all away (I don't mean he's not kind anymore, but I feel like he has less sympathy for most people.). I mean, I get why, he's been through a great amount of trauma. But, it's still sad to seem him easily just go and kill people, without really a second thought. Eren changed, I'm not sure if it's for worse or for better though. I get why he's doing this, he's not only doing it for him, but also for his comrades. For a better world. But, he's honestly doing it in the worst way possible. His actions aren't anywhere near justified either. But, I still respect him for caring about his friends. (Many people may argue and say he doesn't care about his friends, especially Mikasa, but I feel like he does, but he just can't show it atm. As well as the fact that he only has (I think) 2 years too live, I feel like he's going all out and trying to break bonds with people so when he dies they won't be hurt by it.)

Enjoyment/overall 6/10 - Don't get me wrong, this season was good. But I feel like the last 3 seasons were more my style, along with more exciting plot-twists. Hopefully, Season 4 part 2 is more enjoyable. But, only time will tell.. :) (I know I shouldn't re-write reviews, but I felt like I needed to rewrite this one, especially because I feel like even when I gave it a 8, I didn't really think it deserved one, I was just going off of other peoples opinions. Which, I don't like doing.)",2021-01-30T15:25:00+00:00,6
"I have read the manga and know it gets even better obviously it is not perfect as no anime is but the score 10 is for a masterpiece and aot is exactly that. people hate on it is because it is a popular show and this happens with many other good anime as well. Attack on titan for me is definitely one of the best out there.attack on titan has one of the best story which is one its major strength it was done nicely by wit and mappa does not deserve the hate it gets by the fandom.with unbelievable character development which happens inthis season it will result in atleast top three anime. The manga not ended yet and who knows what will happen.

"{No spoilers}'Attack on titan' Probably the best show i have ever seen. I am a big fan of this series so my review can be a little biased but it is what it is.Introduction:The attack on titan is one of that anime that i avoided for many times......its all because i made a very bad stereotype about it first i thought it would be some stupid story about Giants and little creatures but after all the review i seen on internet i decided to watch it and OMG!! what am i missing. I remember binging it all days and nights and you wont believe buti just finished it in 3 days. After s3 part 2 I was so much curious that i decided to read little bit of manga and again i just fell so much in it that i binged all of this in just 1 day😂 so in this review i am just going to give manga review as well but wont spoil it.

Story: 10/10
Absolute masterpiece....if u are anime only then you can't imagine whats coming.....after reading manga i can say that Hajime Isayama is a LEGEND. I have never seen a story like that in my whole anime experience.........He has just taken attack on titan to whole another level. I am not gonna spoil anything but the story is going insane and mind blowing.

Art: 10/10
I know some people are complaining about new cg titans but for me this looks great. At least we should thank mappa for giving us a brand new season.....For me new animation is amazing and believe me or not i loved it more then previous seasons....ah but all persons have different tastes so i cant say anything.

Sound: 10/10
OMG! what can i say to the sound.....all the sound effect are absolutely amazing. I just really love how they used the music during the fights it just f**** gives me goosebumps. Amazing work.


Character: 9/10
characters are very vast in attack on titan due to that sometimes it gets confusing. And last but not least I HATE GABI.


Enjoyment: 10/10
IF you don't enjoy attack on titan then you are sick bro.


Overall: 10/10
Attack on titan final season an anime that has so much hype that it can break the internet in its final arc so for me it has no competition and it is absolute masterpiece",2021-01-29T23:10:00+00:00,10
"Attack on titan season 4 is good. My favorite is gabi. gabi is very cute and nice. She is a very good character. She is a good one. I aso like pieck. Pieck is a very good character. I think ppl should like attack on titan based on these reasons. In addition to this, i think eren is a very bad character. That is okay because every show needs to have a villain.I really like the story of attack on titan. It talk s about titans and I think that titans are very very cool. If they were in the real world, i would bea survey corps member
.

The art is not that good, but passable. It reminds me of anime that don't have good art, but the story makes up for it.",2021-01-26T21:15:00+00:00,10
"Attack on titan, this show needs no introduction. It is the pinnacle of anime and one of the best shows ever produced. (this review contains spoilers)Story:10The story is unique and interesting. I was always on the edge of my seat while watching it and i was never bored all throughout. Isayama did something truly incredible in the way that he took a risk most mangakas wont which is completely changing the script. It went from a mystery survival story to an all out war story.Art:7Although i like the CGI there is no doubt that the animation isn't as good as the other seasons but itmost definitely not as bad as some critics think. Besides the titan CGI the rest of the animation is top tier.
Sound:10
The music in attack on titan is some of the most iconic in anime and the new op is phenomenal as well as the music in the show really brings up the mood.
Character:10
Attack on titan has multiple characters who i have as a 10/10, these include Eren, Renier, Zeke and Ymir. But not only that but there isn't a single character i would rate lower than a 6 and it has some great powerful female characters.

"story - 10, outstandingthe story is absolutely amazing. the insane amount of thought that went into attack on titan is mindblowing. if you're reading this review, you are probably already aware of this.art - 10, outstandingthe art is absolutely a 10. i was so hyped to see the scouts and they look better than ever after the time skip (the marleyans do as well). personally, i prefer the mappa art style over wit. while mappa does use a lot of cgi, their cgi looks clean, unlike the usual awkward cgi. you also have to add in the fact that mappa had very little time towork on this and they're understaffed, so the result they produced in such a short amount of time is impressive. with more time, i think they could've done even better than they already have. 

sound - 10, outstanding

sound is great. i love all of their voices and all of the sound effects. amazing work.

character - 10, outstanding

like i said earlier, if you're reading this, you already know how great of a writer isayama is. the character development is top tier.

enjoyment - 8, very good

while i absolutely love aot, the thing that brings down enjoyment for me is how short each episode is. i know that most anime episodes are 20 minutes, and i don't blame mappa or isayama for this. nevertheless, it still affects my review.

overall - 9, great

overall, i give the season (so far) a 9. i never give 10s, because i believe a masterpiece is almost impossible to achieve. however, if this season keeps up its good reputation, i may change my mind.",2021-01-25T17:03:00+00:00,9
"The greatest show that ever made!!!!This serie has the highest rating for single episodes ever. Over 40 episodes have been rated more than 9, this is absolutely crazy. I still can't understand how in general it's rated 8.9! I hope it reaches at least 9.5 soon.It's a masterpiece, I think we won't ever see again on a screen such a perfection. As someone below said, I hope that the next generations may enjoy and remember it forever. What a time to be alive!WIT was good too, but this is whole another level. I wish they had more time (like extra 4 or 6 months) sowe could see this 10/10 episode in 11/10 form. Best episode of Shingeki no Kyojin so far. Also, what is the deal with people in review page? Don't they know live stream exist?

anyway, Have you ever felt that your breath is being taking away for 20 mins and you finally got to breath?

With no doubts AoT can do !!! Not able to blink , firmly watching in tension couldn't even know where to focus ! Is it OST? Fight scenes? Eren? Survey Corps?the fear expressions? The massacre? Chaos? That was INSANELY a masterpiece!!!

It is just a World War III !

Thank you Isayama , Thank you MAPPA.",2021-01-25T05:03:00+00:00,10

"Well damn.This season of AoT was by far the darkest of the bunch. Everything is more grim than in the previous seasons. As always the art and sound were great like in previous seasons, the story is nothing less than a modern masterpiece. But what I liked and enjoyed  the most this season was actually the character development.Every character has gotten more mature and more grim, but Eren has had the most development  by far. He's nothing like before, he's not just an angry brat who screams or cries or acts rash and without thinking no. Now he's calm and calculating, doesn't crackunder pressure, he's also infinitely more ruthless and has got more control over his power. With these developments Eren is differentiated from the common shounen protagonists like Midoriya from bnha or Naruto or Natsu from fairy tail. In my opinion this version of Eren is far more interesting.",2021-04-12T21:40:00+00:00,9
"*This is my first ever review on this site so some paragraphs down below might look pretty rough but I'm sure you'll understand.I'm not going to pretend that this show is without controversy because it very much is and this season is no exception. So it delights me to say that I greatly enjoyed how MAPPA has adapted this show as a manga reader. But being someone who has grown more interested in the entertainment/writing medium, I think it's important to point out things that maybe didn't quite settle in very well with me.Story: 5/5The story at this point in the show hasbecome far more complex than ever and it feels like this show is finally stretching its legs in terms of exploring themes that probably only touched the surface in previous seasons. The switch up to focus on completely new characters like Gabi and Falco adds new layers by giving us the other side of the story. Never at any point was bored with any of the more dialogue-heavy episodes because the show's pacing meant that there was always something happening in each episode.  I do not doubt that some might still feel unempathetic even despite what Isayama has tried to put here but for many who probably didn't enjoy the animation, it seems like the story has done the hard carrying here.

A little background if you will...

Now we're at the controversial part of this season specifically and that being the animation. There's been a lot of buzz about the abundance of CG Titans which has led to some dropping the anime entirely for the manga and others harassing the animators on Twitter. So a little bit of context because you will very frequently see this in any kind of industry, where countless stories across the movie and tv industry where stories are left untold, heavily altered, or rushed because the production emphasized pushing for the largest audience, the biggest bucks, etc. You're either forced by those creative limitations or you never get anything at all.  With the AOT manga ending in April, Kodansha wanted to push out a season before that to capitalize on the profits that come from it, albeit, under very strict deadlines, less than a year to be specific which is below the average anime production schedule. So really, given that pretty much most studios gave Kodansha the hard 'no,' MAPPA wasn't really much of a choice; having to resort to CGI. Had every studio turned it down, we would've never gotten a 4th season. So there's that.

Art: 3.5/5

Would scenes hit harder if they were hand-drawn? Sure, but I think what Hayashi Yuuichirou, who previously directed Dorohedoro, has done here with the CG is pretty darn good. This is by far the best CG AOT has had so far. Most of the camera direction for CGI heavy scenes are fantastic to the eye and I think without it, the action-heavy fight scenes wouldn't have hit nearly as hard. And can we talk about the use of lighting because my god, it is absolutely stunning. There are still issues though.  While the CG models look pretty good for the most part IMO, a lot of people did take issue with a few standouts, mainly the Attack Titan. I personally didn't mind how he looked but I know a lot of people did and I think it would be significant not to point that out. I do wish though there were at least some textures and some of the camera shots were as a user on sakugabooru put it: ""really tight up and didn't give a good establishment of the battle""(Sabotower). There were also plenty of 2d scenes that were quite a bit rougher than I would like but otherwise, everything else looks great but do keep the CG in mind. Hopefully, Kodansha doesn't screw them over this but looking at recent news, I'm a little worried.

Sound: 4/5

Kohta Yamamoto fully composes the music for this season with some reused tracks from Hiroyuki Sawano on the side. Now Kohta has worked with Sawano before and continues to collab with him in Blue Exorcist Kyoto Saga, CRISIS, Seven Deadly Sins Seasons 2, 3, and 4, SIGN, Kingdom Season 3, the Kabaneri mobile game, and most recently, the adaption of the light novel, 86. I don't have any complaints here but I'm giving it a 9 because it's missing that zest that Sawano has. It's great but it hasn't reached the stratosphere...yet.

Characters: 4.5/5

My thoughts on most of Survey Corp remain largely the same as aside from a few exceptions, most of the side characters are fine. Reiner, Eren, and Zeke are much more fleshed out here and it's fascinating deconstructing their morals, seeing parallels, and how they've changed to face surrounding circumstances. And with Gabi, it's tough not to see a properly indoctrinated and trained version of Eren which speaks to the grand scheme of things. Yet no matter what, you always get the feeling that there is something the characters aren't telling you with some of the 'abnormal' decisions they come to in this arc in particular. 

VII

I've never had this much fun analyzing a show like this in a while. This is one of the few popular animes at the moment that deserves all the hype and more. If MAPPA can polish and refine its aspects as I cautiously hope it will, this will be a modern classic adaption in the making. Until then, we can only wait.",2021-03-28T22:14:00+00:00,9
"Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season is the buildup to what will hopefully be one of the most amazing finales ever. While I think Season 3 part 2 was overall more impactful and well done, The Final Season is definitely pretty great in its own ways. It builds off of what Season 3 created to create something quite fantastic.The plot is as all over the place as it always is, with its numerous twists and turns and new developments. While I don't feel it was as good as some of what came before, its story was quite on par with what came before. My onecomplaint is that it occasionally feels a bit rushed at points. While I don't think it's a major piece of criticism, I do believe that there are a few parts that could have been developed a bit more.

The newer characters introduced in Season 3 aren't exactly the pinnacle of the show's character writing, but they are all quite fine enough, with none of them really blending in with the rest of the shows already large cast or feeling unnecessary. But I think the main things to be said about how Season 4 treats its characters is how it develops its preexisting characters. I'm not personally too big of a fan of Doomer-Eren, but I like all of the other developments made. I especially like the way they fully fleshed out Zeke's character and backstory.

The fights in this portion of the series were also quite fantastic. They introduced some new titans which adds some variety to the preexisting lineup of massive fleshy battle machines. The fights felt epic and dynamic as they always do, and with the previous developments of the story, have some new and interesting elements included. My one major complaint is the lack of an epic final battle in the last episode. Especially given how the previous episodes before that one were mainly story focused, it's sort of lame to have to wait for the second cour before I can see some new titan smashing content.

The Final Season is proving itself to be the beginning of a great finale. It meets my expectations for the series and successfully hypes me up for the upcoming conclusion. Here's to hoping they can pull through without shooting themselves in the leg.",2021-09-25T23:11:00+00:00,9
"I'm giving this season an 8, but I'm doing it VERY reluctantly. If I was asked to rate just the episodes up til the conclusion of the attack on Liberio, I'd have rated it a 9, maybe even a high 9. Unfortunately, the whole story after the attack on Liberio just went downhill, spiralling down the abyss like nobody's business. The pacing got worse and worse, the characters' motivations are kind of off, which makes their choices a little hard to believe...The most obvious example is the honorary Marleyans' unyielding loyalty to Marley. This doesn't just apply to Gaby, but to Pieck and Gaillard andall the others. How are they not even a little swayed by Zeke and Eren? Especially Pieck's rationalisation at the last episode, ""I don't trust Marley but I trust my comrades"" Like, hello? Under Marley, you, your comrade, your family and all your descendants will be forever stuck as tools for war or just lesser humans. Like she said herself, once Marley squeezes them dry of their usefulness, they'll be discarded like a worn out mop. 

If she said she's fighting Paradis for the people she's lost in Liberio and how both Marley and Paradis are treating people like tools anyway... I'd have found that more believable. Instead... we got this ""I trust my comrades"" bullshit. *smh* Anyway, that's just one example but I can't be bothered to raise more. 

Low 8, borderline 7 for me.",2021-03-28T21:50:00+00:00,8
"Contains spoilers for AoT, until s4ep12Isayama, just keeps 1uping himself, Assault was one of the best episodes I have ever watched in anime. Now ill give a brief review and overview on the past seasonsS1- Solid, We get to see eren training for most of the season, with the great battle of eren  vs the female titan, great first season, got me hooked on the show, some major plot points get revealed which you don't realize while watching, but when you get to the later seasons it all adds up. S1 is a 9.5/10 overallS2- Starts of slowly, even though its short 12ep run.Great plot twist, I literally gasped when the armored titan and the colossal titans identity got revealed, solid battle at the end as well, s2 was slightly better than s1 imo 9.7/10

S3p1- this season wasn't as good as the previous 2, mainly because there wasn't really any ATTACK ON TITANS in this season, still very good tho, we get to learn about the Ackermanns and the reiss family in this season, 9/10

S3p2- HOLY SHIT, was this good, the entire season is basically a masterpiece, midnight sun, the basement, hero. All of which are bangers 10/10

S4- I have seen uptill ep 12, first 2 episodes I thought were filler, until I saw episode 3s end, which shows why the first 2 episodes happened like it did, Assault as I said was a banger
Also Fuck Gabi

"*SPOILER WARNING BEFORE READING, THIS COVERS BOTH AOT S4 PART 1 AND THE MANGA, DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE NOT AT THAT POINT*I may or may not be sort of bias, but this masterpiece of a shonen is one of, if not my favorite anime of all time, and oh boy, anime onlies, you have not seen nothing yet, season 4 part 2 is going to truly blow away your socks off, the ending may divide you on whether it’s good or not, but oh my god, it is 100% worth the ride, it is one of the few anime I can say liveup to the hype it deserves, from starting as a pilot in 2006 all the way to 2021 somehow still being amazing still blows my mind to this day, and we have to wait until 2022 for new content on the anime, hyped, cannot wait for the rumbling arc to be animated, MAPPA is doing a fantastic job, if not at some points better that WIT and they were pretty damn good at animating this. The characters, there is no one on the good side, and no one on the bad side in this anime, everyone has a point to why and what they’re doing and pull it off excellently. Sound, 11/10, the voice actors give so much effort just to make a good line pull off, it’s amazing how good the voice acting is, AND THE MUSIC SLAPS SO HARD, My War, Shock, and Ashes in the Fire are probably some of the boppiest bops that will ever bop in this show, I can’t. Story, 10, from going from a story about avenging a beloved one by trying to kill all the titans with traitors behind our backs to being a story about trying to win by having to cause a genocide, is amazing, I have no words to describe how good it is. Obviously this show is not perfect, obviously it has a few bumps and cracks, but it’s with the more good parts that outweigh the bad, thank you Isayama for creating such a legendary series that we will all hold deep in our hearts forever",2021-04-22T07:14:00+00:00,10
"This is just going to be a short (and not a nice one) review, hahaha, sorry. I just find this series so hard to write a review. Not because it was bad, but following this series for this long left me a bit speechless so it's pretty difficult to describe how this series made me feel.I’ll try my hardest not to drop some major spoilers below. So read on your own risk, *wink.Opening & Closing ThemesI’m not sure if this is only me, but there’s just something about Attack on Titan’s opening themes that really excites you. The music and the animation is just soeerie that you can’t help but get excited with anticipation of what's going to happen next. And as for this final season, you wouldn't expect less from MAPPA.

The closing theme is just a simple one like in any other anime series, but you can easily tell that it's from Attack on Titan just by listening to the song alone. I don't know how to describe it, but all songs used in this series share “that” unique characteristic that its viewers can already tell that it’s from Attack on Titan.
Story
If you are already reading this review, chances are, you have already watched the previous seasons so I’m not going to elaborate on this series’ overall plot.

Attack on Titan’s final season shows us both the Paradis Island and the Marley Empire. The first few episodes really had me confused because I was expecting that it will start on Paradis Island like the previous seasons. But instead, it showed us life in the Marley Empire. One thing that really stood out for me here is the way Marleyan treats Eldians badly because of their ""devil"" blood. While watching these episodes, I can't really help but weigh in the reasoning behind these two countries' conflict.

New settings, means new faces, so yep, we've got to meet some new people here and see how they will affect the story.

Just like with the other seasons, this one has some pretty shocking revelations and discoveries, especially if like me, you’re not following the manga.The adrenaline is still there, the blood, and those amazing entrances will not fail to still make you get super excited.
Same as the previous season, the final season is also divided into 2 parts. I believe the 2nd part will be airing next year. But after that cliffhanger ending, I’m pretty sure a lot of viewers have read the manga now. I’ve been seeing some spoilers accidentally in my facebook feed, so I might give in and start reading the manga too once I get available,*wink.
Characters
Now that we are already in its final season, all the main and supporting characters have really grown (except for Levi though, wahahaha).

Eren on the other hand looks really grim. All throughout his introduction, all I could ask myself is “Where’s that annoying Eren that I know?”. It's been so long since I’ve watched the previous season so the change in Eren’s characters (especially physical) comes as a surprise to me. I remember when the trailer of this season was first dropped, anime fans were really ecstatic.

I was spoiled before I watched this series so it's hard to describe Eren’s sudden change of plan. It’s like meeting the old Lelouch lol.

The sudden death of one of the most liked characters in AoT really really had me worried. I got spoiled again on this one, so I was really eager to know how that happened. So yep, imagine my surprise on who did it. Grrr.

There’s this one character that I really really really as in super duper hate. She’s only just a kid, but the amount of hate you could feel from her is greater than any hateful characters you could think of. Her hypocrisy is so appalling that it even contradicts her iconic line “But did you see it happen?”. Urghh, just thinking about her makes me seething in anger.
Art
I’m really no expert on this one, wahahaha. But overall, I think it was pretty good. I actually like the grave facial expressions of the characters whenever there’s a problem or they get eaten by a titan.
Voice Actor
I've been watching this series in both English and Japanese interchangeably since season 1, and I guess you could say that it's now hard for me to say if it's bad at this point, hahaha.

Eventhough I prefer the Japanese dub (we always do), I still think that the English dub was done well. Although even already at the final season, I still can't warm up with Eren's English VA. I'm not sure if it's just me, I just think that his voice doesn't fit well on his character. Other than that, no complaints from me, *wink.

***
After that ending, I can't wait to see part 2. Although I’m sure I’m not the only one, *wink.",2021-09-12T01:47:00+00:00,8
"This first half of the final season didn't quite resonate with me the way I had been expecting.  I actually loved reading this stuff so I don't quite understand why I felt that way. I think maybe the transition from Wit to MAPPA had something to do with it. The transition was very jarring. Because while the story was great, and the pacing was good, and the acting was great, and the music was great, the animation at times was hit or miss. I can't recall specifically which episodes, but there's a stretch of episodes (maybe 11-14) where the animation quality is kinda awfulto the point that it was distracting. And while I was watching these crappy looking scenes I couldn't help but think of the show's better days. I'm not going to bash MAPPA as I think they're a quality studio which took on a tough job. Nonetheless, animation quality somewhat affected my enjoyment of the show.

Despite the crude looking visuals in some episodes, there is plenty of eye candy throughout the season. I was always impressed with the Colossal Titan scenes, whereas (ironically) in the Wit adaptation those scenes where usually the ugliest part of every season they animated.

As I mentioned earlier, every other aspect aside from the hit or miss visuals was excellent. So, I feel this season was a success.",2021-03-28T20:02:00+00:00,10
"Another fantastic season of Attack on Titan. I picked up the manga near the beginning of the Marley arc, so it was such a joy getting to see this arc animated after reading these chapters month by month over the past few years. Initially, I was nervous about the studio change, but I think MAPPA did an excellent job trying to keep the integrity of Attack on Titan that Wit previously brought. In fact, this was the best arc to change studios since there was a four year time skip. I will admit some of the scenes that MAPPA reanimated were slightly jarring, and Iwould have preferred they had kept the Wit version, but I felt that MAPPA did an excellent job in terms of character models matching the manga.

In terms of animation, While I will admit that, especially near the beginning of the series, the CGI and animation techniques were sometimes slightly jarring and altered my enjoyment, there were also brilliantly animated scenes in this season as well, and the CGI titans are really not as horrendous as everyone makes them out to be. (Animated survey corps is another thing, but we don't need to get into the mess of THAT particular episode). I feel like MAPPA got a lot of unnecessary hate this season despite putting forward their best efforts to make this season the best it could be. Quite honestly, I wasn't always a fan of Wit's animation, and I felt like MAPPA was always really trying its best to give its viewers a satisfactory adaptation of Attack on Titan.

Even though I may have had some gripes with the animation, and while the soundtrack is not as good as previous seasons, the story is still what carries Attack on Titan, and for this reason I still think this anime deserves a 10. MAPPA did a fantastic job in its portrayal of this part of the manga. I appreciated the slightly slower pacing at times in order to create tense, emotionally-driven scenes. MAPPA really knew how to adapt this story to its full potential, and the occasional anime-only scenes added in always complemented the plot. I could tell MAPPA was doing its best to present a faithful story, and they did just that. This season blew it out of the water, and while personally I think I still consider the Return to Shiganshina arc to be my favorite, I always loved the direction Isayama took this story when I was reading the manga, and this arc is just as strong as that previous arc (if not stronger, some would argue). Looking forward to the final adaptation of this series in 2022.

TL;DR: Don't let the studio change or sudden new characters/setting scare you. MAPPA continues to keep the integrity of the series. This is yet another amazing season of Attack on Titan, and it is equally on par with (if not better) than Season 3 Part 2.",2021-03-28T20:02:00+00:00,10
"Undoubtedly the best part of Shingeki, as someone who started reading the manga because he was hypado for this season, I say that exactly what I expected was delivered, quality animation, epic scenes and wonderful dialogues.First of all, yes I believe that if the anime ended in the beach scene it would be a good, predictable, but good.But discussions about the ending I do later.As for this season all I can say is that it showed what Shingeki is about; a work that talks about how the desire and the search for something ends up with a man psychologically, and the ""world outside"". Isayama isable to show with mastery in his art and in small dialogues how these battles make his characters feel very bad with the whole environment, thus generating a pleasant development in much of the cast. (I can't give spoilers, but I do think that Shingeki develops character well, but excellently well, only a few).

As for animation, at first I didn't think anything was too much, seeing all those people praising Mappa didn't make sense to me, since the CG in humans was really horrible. But after the battle I noticed how wonderful Mappa is, with one of the best storyboard works I've ever seen in my life. Episodes 5 and 15 are clear examples of how an excellent storyboard can generate something superior to the original work that was already wonderful.

About the characters (this will take time):

Yeager, Eren- Undoubtedly the most developed of the work, at the beginning of the anime it generated excellent dialogues, making evident all its weariness with the situation and anger, and desire for freedom. Counting on an excellent work from your VA, with many feelings in your voice. Despite being very tasty, his attitudes are extremely wrong, I will not even speak ""in my opinion"", because I consider any type of act similar to his extremely abominable. I'm sorry to talk about my position in my review, I just found it necessary, since it was a very discussed topic.

Ackerman, Mikasa- Undoubtedly the one that generates the best scenes. Seeing all his love and hope for Eren being put to the test, generates scenes extremely well directed and with sentimental dialogues that I liked the most, for talking about what Shingeki said was about ""constant battles make people exhausted""

Arlert, Armin- My favorite character from SnK. Your whole worldview is just beautiful, seeing your purity being destroyed by this horrible world hurts my heart. Having a phenomenal character development, generating excellent dialogues and scenes about his friendship with Eren. His scene with ***** is very cute.

Braun, Reiner- took the post of Shingeki's third best character, after the first episodes of this season. With the best development of Shingeki, Reiner manages to be an extremely human character, with very realistic feelings, I just love the first 5 episodes that approach his psychological deepest. The ***** and the **** are excellently good directed.

Levi and Zoë, Hange- I love how they became lost people after Erwin's death. The season addresses excellently well how much they depended on Erwin's decision-making ability for anything, making it even more evident that all they want is to get out of this horrible world. I just love them both, any scene with them is wonderful, their voice actors are just phenomenal not to mention that Levi has one of the scenes with the best storyboard of the season.

Gabi and Falco- My fourth favorite SnK characters (since both are complete, I consider it as if they were just 1). Gabi is excellent, all the scenes that demonstrate her indoctrination are phenomenal and with very well constructed dialogues. Falco is simply too pure for this world and his love for Gabi is something very cute to see, not to mention that even if he doesn't agree with her, they manage to live together, admirable. Gabi, yes I love you, I would adopt you, the doctrine that fell on you is not your fault, you have an excellent development (and you will have).

Soldiers of Marley- I will not say what they are because of spoilers. So you're reading this without seeing the anime, good luck trying to understand. I love Pieck, undoubtedly an excellent waifu, as well as Yelena, who has a very doubtful personality, but I still like her, since her motivations and idealism are very well explained. I also like Galliard a lot, since its entire backstory generates excellent doors for development. Zeke is just perfect, counting on the best episode of the season for himself. I especially love Nicolo for identifying me very much with him, his love is also very pure for this horrible world.

Zeke's episode- Perfect, just perfect, very well directed, with a brilliant storyboard and perfect VA work.

Jean- I will not talk about Connie or Sasha, as they remain the same. But Jean, one of my favorite characters, clearly demonstrates how he evolves as a person. Exalting maturity in situations, dealing with other soldiers in an extremely human way, after all Marco taught him that they are not just numbers.

Finally, I would like to say yes, I consider this the second best part of Shingeki, as it is one of the most epic and well elaborated of the 3, with extremely well directed scenes and breathtaking storyboard. Not counting the opning which is very good.

Grade: 10 (Not because he is a perfumer, but because his small mistakes are easily compensated by the joy of watching, in real SnK everything is like this)",2021-03-28T20:32:00+00:00,10
Absolutely phenomenal season with an ending that leaves you craving for more. The animation and artwork was a little bit sus sometimes but the storytelling and writing was so great that it didn't bother me too much. Overall just a great first half of the season and I can't wait to see more. I gotta keep typing to reach the character limit unfortunately so just ignore my blabbering. ya dee da dee da da EREN YEAGER ya dee da dee da da TATAKAE ya dee da dee da da KENNY ya dee da dee da da I keep moving forward.

"The most popular and polarizing season of AOT, season 4.  I either see 50% of the people hate this season, or 50% calling this peak fiction.  Personally, I would lean towards the 2nd option.   Story 10/10: The plot is on a totally different path, and you don't know what to expect next.  There is nothing predictable in AOT anymore and it's like a whole new anime.  That's pretty much it I can say without spoiling, even though I bet most people already got spoiled. Art 8.5/10:  Mappa did a good job for their time constraints.  Their 2danimation is amazing, really showcasing how dark this season is.   They used a shit ton of cgi, which was actually really good for cgi, but still not as good as 2d titans.  I did not feel that thrill anymore when the ODM gear was used though.   

Sound 10/10: The opening is amazing and so symbolic, with the soundtracks being my favorite out of all of AOT.   

Character 10/10: If I had to give an 11/10, it would be this category.  Eren's character development was insane and he was definitely the highlight of the season. Reiner's and Zeke's backstories made me sympathize with them and the rest of their people too much, and it was very hard for me to root for anyone this whole season.   

Enjoyment 9.5/10:  This would be rounded to a 10/10 but I did not enjoy it just as much as season 3 part 2, because it still had many just talking scenes, and it was more a set up season for season 4 part 2 rather than a culmination of events. 

Overall 10/10: Tied with Season 3 part 2 as my favorite season, and definitely the most mind-blowing season out of them all.",2021-11-04T22:18:00+00:00,10
"Now since i have re watched this again i feel like my review will be good (maybe)Ereh was a guy who was pretty much a screaming simulator season 4 upgraded him from screaming simulator to being addicted to freedom. Since i have red and finished the manga which the last chapter was a disappointment. Looking back at the anime which is very overrated because when season 2 - s3 part 2 was released I have not heard anything from anyone in my neighborhood about this anime. Then season 4 released and apparently everyone knows it season 3 part 2 was such a goat i wasdamn surprised that no one heard it but everyone has heard of season 4 wtf?.

Anyways don't mind me back to the actual review I dont really mind the CGI that much i mean to be fair season 3's CGI was way damn worse i mean who wouldn't want a CGI monke?. The character development was great because somehow in some way they cried so much at sasha's death while forgetting about erwin's come on guys. the character i did not care about the past seasons actually made me care about them or basically i remember they're names. I'm gonna be honest i did not know floch existed at the past seasons but here he is anyways 9/10 would've been better if yes.",2021-09-02T22:43:00+00:00,9
"This anime has been mind-boggling to say the least. This Part 1 of the Final Season really carried on the legacy that is Attack On Titan. Regardless of the hate that MAPPA has received for the use of CGI, the animation quality has been through the roof when the characters were animated, and regardless of some loss of immersion from the CGI, I felt completely hyped during every episode and every fight scene. I also read the manga beforehand, and yet every episode left me with a sense of excitement. They did an amazing job recreating the anime pretty much word for word from themanga, and if I'm talking about the first part of Season 4 as a whole, the story is amazing. Of course, the story has always been amazing but the third season and this season take the cake. The character development and storyline has developed so much, especially with Eren Jaeger. 

The complexity of the story continues to develop as we watch all kinds of worldly issues be addressed such as morality, political corruption, violence, racism, prejudice, and probably more that I cannot think of off the top of my head. 

The way that the characters are made make them seem like real people rather than just characters. To be honest, I cannot wait for the second part of this season as I believe it will probably break the internet and most likely top FMA:Brotherhood.",2021-04-03T10:11:00+00:00,10
"I've never seen a serie likes Attack on titan. It's so detailed and very exciting.Attack on titan was my thrid anime and my first action anime. I did not expect anything from this season, I was always surprised. Story: 10You can not change my mind. The whole serie is connected to each other and every time when something new happens I do not expect it. This story is overal very detailed and clear.art: 10I see some people write about how bad Mappa made this final season but I love it!!! The CGI looks good and the animation too. Mappa did not have a lot oftime to animate every fight scene, that's the reason why they decided to make some scenes with a lot of CGI. But even with the CGI it's very exciting and beautiful!

Sound: 10

The sound fits perfectly to all the scenes, the intro and outro are way to catchy and listen to it almost every day.

Character: 8

I think Eren Yeager is a lot more annoying than the other seasons. I don't like Gabi either but all the other charaters are written very good.

Enjoyment: 9

Sometimes I was  a little bit confused but that's maybe because english and japanese are not my first language. It's sometimes a little bit more difficult to understand what they mean. but overall is Attack on titan cristal clear!


I do recommend this to everyone who loves a good story with action and a lot of details.

I give this season a 9/10.",2021-03-29T08:28:00+00:00,9
"So, i really liked season 4 (first part) and i loved the new cgi. The CGI from season 1-3 was really horrible. This is an important part of the story, and they adapted it very well. New characters are good, and the only thing I don't like is that Eren becomes a really mainstream character, and that some important characters become really secondary and side characters. Some moments are really exciting, like the handshake part, and I enjoyed watching 1 episode for week because I'd never be bored in that way. So, in overall, s4 is an 8/10, surely not the best AOT season, butsurely not the worst.",2021-10-09T12:56:00+00:00,8
"Attack on Titan suffers from the same disease of Berserk; if it's not a masterpiece, it's not ENOUGH.A rushed animation was not capable of wasting this classic, but was capable of making outstanding moments, just cool. And make a gorgeous anime just look good. What Mappa did with the first part of the season finale of SnK is miraculous. Everybody who worked here probably broke some animation world record. For some reason the producers behind this wanted this season to drop so much, just to announce another part???If you're not going to already finish the show, why rush so much something that could easily takemore time?
And what a wrong time to rush the thing up! 

This season is supposed to be a new anime of the same anime. 
Attack on Titan is not what it was always used to be. 
It's more political, more philosophical, characters have evolved in other wills, not so good new characters are leading the role, old characters are just less attractive this season. And all this flaws and sins could have being great, if guess what? They had more TIMEEEEEE

The overall narrative is actually crazy, but how is portraid is nothing great. The world outside of the wall it's very boring. It's your general military world, that was supposed to look relatable, but people there actually kill people because their race and also slave them, so how am i supposed have any simpathy for them. 
And the characters that we were supposed to care, besides having an annoying personality, they have to counter the older characters from the show, that have way more plot and development, so even if they were cool characters, we would have trouble to like them anyways. 

The visuals are good, the directors had some good artistic shots, but you can see that without the proper time they could not have made a lot about it, so they cutted a lot of stuff off, used walls, explosions, lightining, smoke, and camera look aways to mascarade everything.  
The CGI is meh, but it would not matter, even if was the best CGI in the world, it would still look  horrible, because this is ATTACK ON TITAN! We want what he had already, a legendary cool 2D animation! That was capable of make a cup of tea conversation look marvelous! And now we having a marvelous fights looking like a cup of tea conversation. 

If you liked Attack on Titan because of the narrative, you'll enjoy the show but you'll feel a lack of epic moments like in the other seasons.
If you liked AoT because of the fights and the climax  you'll enjoy way lesser what you're seeing.

 Attack on Titan is an epic show. Strandards  are all way out of this planet, what this season brought was just another good anime, and that it's impossible for a masterpiece like this. 
All the love for the staff and all the rage for the brilliant people that rushed this show.",2021-03-30T08:56:00+00:00,6
"Boom, beem, badabash.9/10, Sorry MAPPA.The three biggest drawn of AoT for me were the animation, the story, and the music. Out of these three, none impressed me.SPOILERS BELOWAnimationObviously no one is going to think the animation is good, not when we go from WIT's once in a lifetime quality to cheap 3D animation. Sure, what we got in the given timeframe was good, but you can't ignore that S 1 - 3 were a joy to watch simply for the visuals. My God, I miss WIT's clouds and backgrounds. After watching a video comparison of S 1 - 3 with S4 I also noticed howmany stills MAPPA used.

Art
Branching off slightly from animation, I just wanted to say I like the new art style. Combined with the new character designs, it really shows how much they've all grown and matured over the four year story gap.

Story
Eren is now the fattest pile of steaming horse excrement on the planet. For the past 3 seasons all Eren wanted was to be completely free, and now he's advocating for a Euthanasia plan? What? How is not having children to kill of the Eldians considered ""freedom""? And even if this is an act or something that will be explained in S4P2, it doesn't make up for his fall from grace.
Oh, and screw Gabi.

Music
Look, I'm gonna go out and say that I wish Hiroyuki Sawano had written the whole OST himself. Sure, Ashes on the Fire was cool, but it wasn't as epic as Counter Attack Mankind or as badass as YouSeeBigGirl. I enjoyed the new tracks we did get, specifically the Jaegerists' and Niccolo's themes, but I can't help but feel we could have gotten a slightly more... complex main track.

Voice Acting
I primarily watch the dubbed. Unfortunetly, although it is still better than the subbed, I noticed a severe drop in quality (presumably because most of the VA's had to record from home). As for the subbed, Yuki Kaji trying to make his voice deeper to show that Eren has grown just did not cut it for me. It sounds a bit ridiculous.

So, why the 9? Because I still enjoyed it. Notice I said I wasn't impressed, not that I didn't like it. After S3P2, it's going to be very hard for me to be impressed by any anime.

It was worth the watch as the underlying story is still fantastic (it's AoT, for gods sake) but the time restaraints and studio change were not the right move to make.",2021-03-29T08:28:00+00:00,9
"There is no doubt that season four of Attack on Titan was a roller coaster.This season brought me back into the series and I'm so grateful that it did. The deep and complex themes, the surprisingly good animation, the amazing soundtrack, and the new characters all serve to perfectly create what the manga of Attack on Titan is.The story of Attack on Titan past season one really shifts into different themes of corruption, friendship, and so on. This season explores the ideas surrounding war, racism, and morality. There are no antagonists in the series, people who are portrayed as inherently evil are simply victimsof the world. In the famous words of Erwin Smith, ""Who do you think the real enemy is here?""

I condone all the hatred that MAPPA got for the animation of this season, the majority of the complaints were from the use of CGI. In my opinion, the animation level was cutting edge, with so many details and the different lighting of scenes felt smooth. However, the CGI at points felt really bizarre and janky. It would sometimes work but ultimately I would prefer not to use CGI.

The soundtrack perfectly conveys the emotions of the series, each scene feels tense or depressing and the music only amplifies those emotions. The trailer music is something that hypes me up every time I listen to it. Using it at the end of episode 16 made me instantly hyped for the next part. After you get used to the opening, it becomes amazing. Conveying the one main theme of this entire series. War.

Many character's backstories being revealed created so much more for this series. Zeke's backstory reveals the reasoning behind his actions and Reiner's guilt made me truly sympathize with him. Eren's sudden turn into darkness was also a shock for me, after all, he was the suicidal blockhead that stood up for his friends and would never let harm go their way. Now he isn't afraid to emotionally and physically hurt even his closest friends. This truly made me question myself, who are the real enemies?

This season made Attack on Titan my most favorite anime.

Overall, I rank this 9/10.",2021-03-29T07:24:00+00:00,9
SNK is the one of my my favourite animes. anime has a very deep story line and character lore. first 3 season's art was very good but in s4 it could be better but it's not bad at all. tha voice actors are so good at their works and they are bery professional. musics are very amusing. BUT why MAPPA doing 3 animes in the same time i didn't understand it's so hard to animate something and you are doing this for 3 anime anyway try to watch carefully cuz every word have a lore in this anime every word every sentence is a importantif you don't look screen for 5 seconds you are escaping too much things. in the end SNK is a masterpiece.,2021-03-29T09:11:00+00:00,9
"Attack on Titan's final season elevates the series to new heights of greatness. If you thought the reveals at the end of season 3 were the most complicated this story could get, then this season is sure to have your head spinning.The storyline gets even more complex as it deep dives over to Marley where our antagonists reside and gives us their perspective. We get a clearer picture of their lives in the internment zone, their beliefs, what they think is the truth of Eldia's history, what their goals are, and who/what they're fighting for. By the end of the Marley arc (episodes 60-68), alot of fans aren't sure who to root for anymore.

At this point the series is as far from simply being 'good vs. bad' or 'heroes vs. villains' as it can get. It's people fighting for survival, freedom, and what they believe in. The story and the characters got immensely more complex, especially Eren. Our protagonist has developed into a seemingly whole new character over the 4 year timeskip between the end of season 3 and the beginning of the final season. There is a myriad of differing opinions about Eren's actions throughout the season so far. Fans aren't sure what to think of him, but one thing I think they could all agree on is that he has become one of the best written characters we've ever seen in anime. His character development and progression thus far has been nothing short of incredible.

Attack on Titan the final season has been a masterpiece so far and I can't wait for part 2 to see what is sure to be a breathtaking conclusion to this epic series.",2021-04-05T09:39:00+00:00,10
"A very good adaptation, the Mappa studio is quite capable of bringing attack on titan to its level, the storytelling is very accurate with the manga but some scenes that I think are quite important are not shown, quite disappointing but it's not bad, for the animation part is pretty good, very shortcomings stands out in CG, for a series it is quite good and still comfortable to see but it can't be the best yet, I hope in the next story they only use it in the rumbling scene, besides that there are things that make it uncomfortable, namely the character design that issometimes not consistent and proportional but adapting Hajime Isayama style into anime form is very good and what I like the most is the background that looks very detailed and realistic, then the music part is almost perfect, Kohta Yamamoto did a good job, the original music he made in the trailer so epic and totally insane, i've never been semer This inding when listening to music beforehand, and for the voice actors to do their job properly and really very perfectly. 
And here is the final score I gave: 
Story: 90 
Animation: 85 
CG: 80 
Music: 95 
Background art: 100 
Voice actor: 95",2021-04-02T21:36:00+00:00,9
"FMAB fans are salty because their show isn't going to continue being the best. They are trying to make their show the greatest by making it number 1 on myanimelist. But it is no longer the greatest, many shows passed it, and 1 is AOT. If you think that AOT is overrated or FMAB is way better than AOT, you are deluded and in denial. I loved FMAB, don't get me wrong. But FMAB barely had more development for the seven sins instead of the main characters. Yes, Edward develops by the end, but Eren grows every episode and always amazes me. All the sidecharacters have an essential role to play and are written well. Nothing is poorly done, history has no contradiction, and everything comes into play. The theme of the story is well played and has been foreshadowed since the beginning. AOT is a once in a while masterpiece, like Steins-Gate and FMAB. It has 100% passed these shows in terms of all criteria. And anyone who says it's overhyped, overrated, or wrong. Is simply trying to hide from the reality that AOT is better than their anime. In my opinion, One piece is #1, but AOT is also great and deserves to be on top!",2021-04-05T07:19:00+00:00,10
"Once again I won't talk about whole Shingeki no Kyojin, go read previous reviews. And as you know my reviews don't contain spoilers, or at least that's what I think. ;w;As you can see notes, my opinion about The Final Season is worse, but good enough to encourage you to watch Season 4.If you watched 2nd part of Season 3, you know that now this story is at its largest point... and you're wrong, this Season happens couple of years after previous Season, which means that some characters changed their personalities after growing up. You won't see them as same as before. =w=Now when wemove to art point, I remind you that Wit Studio no longer makes episodes of Shingeki no Kyojin after Season 3 part 2, the new studio is Mappa. Some of you might not know, but Mappa was making Jujutsu Kaisen with more quality at the same time during making Attack on Titan. What's the problem then? Answer is CGI, the technology that half of anime community hate. In previous seasons everything except scenes and buildings were drawn, and now you'll see titans who seem like 3D characters. But because Mappa was making Jujutsu Kaisen at the same time, I give it a 7 for effort.

New music themes are still amazing, some people may not like opening and ending music, but I could even listen to opening for 1 hour. :P

Some AOT fans don't like new characters, for me they are actually very good, they don't ruin anything but they actually give new plot twists.

Something about ejoyment seems different than watching previous seasons. I think that's because animations are made differently and it's hard to apply to them. Try to compare to first ever episodes and you'll see what I mean, but it isn't that boring to stop watching until the end, because heyy  it's ""The Final Season"". 

Because of new art level, I give overall a 9, I don't know how with other people who have watched this already, but for me Attack on Titan is still epic. ;)",2021-04-06T03:22:00+00:00,9
"Quick Review after 10 episodes :Story - Beyond phenomenal and great storytelling overall.Art - The artstyle is great and goes with the manga in a smooth way. The animation is good in a general way, all the animations seem to be very alive and transitions are very refined. Although sometimes the CGI may seem weird  I would not call it bad or awful .Sound - The soundtrack is fantastic and goes well with the scenes . Character - 90% of the cast consists of three-dimensional characters, while the two-dimensional ones are usually good and have a relevance in the narrative, thus creating an engagingand interesting tale.

Enjoyment - Over 9000!!!

Overall - 10/10",2021-02-16T13:48:00+00:00,10
"I know I pretty much only give positive reviews, but when I tell you this is shaping up to be the best anime I've seen in my life I mean this is shaping up to be the best anime I've seen in my life. Episode 66 of Attack on Titan literally kept me shaking and on the edge of my chair. I don't know how to give any details without spoiling it, but take it from a man who has seen 70 different anime, (I haven't given them all ratings because I try to be positive) you will not live to see another episode asgood as episode 66.",2021-01-31T18:57:00+00:00,10
"This really is a one of a kind anime, nothing else has topped it for me. The story is amazing, full of intrigue and it makes you almost doubt which side you're on. Although most people will always be by Eren and support him, I mean cmon his Mom died because of the Marleyans, he's fully entitled to revenge. Even though the studio changed the animation is still top notch, although I do miss WIT's animation style. I have gotten used to and love MAPPA's animation though. OP intro 8/10- I did not expect anything like this but... but you know? it touched my souland it more looks like Attack on slice of life not TITAN :D.

Story 9/10- Story is still awesome

Art 9/10- in the previous seasons was much better but it does not interfere watching.... I like it anyway.

Sound 9/10- The new soundtracks are awesome and deep just like the past seasons

Character 10/10- almost all were behaving like IRL people there's no exaggeration, this is just as I see it.

Enjoyment 10/10- I found myself waiting impatiently every week

Overall 10/10- A true masterpiece",2021-02-01T00:38:00+00:00,10
"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSNow or NeverIf I can summarize episode 6 into simple words, Eren’s “now or never” line will do the trick. Whether you are pro-Marley or on the side of the Devils within the Walls, episode War Hammer Titan is the beginning of a long haul battle between beliefs.The opening scene, which is an anime exclusive, gave us an insight into Willy Tybur’s duties as a father and the paragon of the rest of the world. While I was watching Willy’s kids fondly begging him to stay, I felt sad knowing the events that unraveled in the Declaration of War. Now, it's official:Eren Yeager ate the head of the Tybur family, perhaps thinking he possessed the War Hammer titan power. However, things took a quick turn as Willy’s sister, Lara, transforms into a titan shifter which Eren sought to destroy as soon as possible. On the other hand, Magath fires a single shot to begin Marley’s counterattack against the bearer of the Founding Titan and Attack Titan.

One scene that caught my attention was when Pieck looked astonished and frightened upon seeing and hearing the Survey Corps maneuvering Liberio using their ODM gear. What were once myths to Marleyan people have now come upon the shore to show that they are truly devils. It also took six episodes before we saw more familiar faces which I think is only right to give ample spotlight on the side of the Warriors. Mikasa’s entrance was amazing, the animation during her thunder spear moment was flawless, as well as how she portrayed her feelings of longingness for Eren after years of being apart.

“Please.. come home.”

While all of that was happening, poor Gabi just saw two of her Warrior pals and friend guards crushed and gunned down to their deaths. I would like to commend MAPPA for going the extra mile by adding Sasha to Gabi’s eye reflection when the two girls’ eyes met. In my opinion, MAPPA rightfully portrayed Gabi’s tremendous rage towards the island devils.

“I just don’t understand why they [Udo and Zofia] had to die…”

Overall, this week’s episode is the turning point for both the hunter and the hunted. The scouts have been unleashed, Eren is a savage, and the Ackermans are to be feared. On the other hand, Marley's titan forces are late to the party but will manage to counter come the next episode. It is, as young people would say it, the Hype episode.

Marley versus Paradis. We are finally seeing the beginning of a historic battle right before our eyes. Years have gone in preparation for this crucial attack. Years have gone by since Eren lived with the enemy. Years have gone by since Reiner stepped foot in Paradis. Years have gone by for Gabi to develop a powerful hatred toward the devils. Everything is set like a scene from a play, now it is up to the actors to move according to plan. It is truly now or never.",2021-01-18T23:09:00+00:00,9
"ok, so people are bitching about the CGI like its fucking Satan. I'm not going to sit here and say that the CGI is my preference, but CGI can be good and in this case it is. I have problems with the jaw titans model, but both Eren and the Warhammer have good models. It pisses me off because some how a show is able to go from a 10/9 to a 1/2 because CGI exists. people view it like auto tune and just think somehow that its always a crutch and cant be a tool. Of course with AOT its not the best, butare you really going to say the CG is worse than season 3 part 2 because its not. the colossal titans CG looks like its from an early PS 2 game. I don't even want to talk about the story in this review because its good, anyone whos still watch the fucking show either agrees or is still watching to hate it. As far as the CG for the scouts in ODM gear, yeah that doesn't look good, but its like 6 frame in the middle of the night and its never focused on. comparing it to berserk is also brain dead because berserk has bad models and choppy CG AOT doesn't, its actually very good. you don't like the CGI and that's fine, but at a certain point you need to look at it and ask ""how much does this matter? how important is it that everything in this is hand drawn?"". Do genuinely believe that the CGI(well done I want to add again) in literally 2 episodes and will probably only be in 4 is so fucking detrimental to your enjoyment of the show that all the other positives are negated by its presence.

For the people who haven't seen it and want to know if its good, it is. It's very faithful to the manga has good direction, the CG isn't fun to have but the models are well made and its at its worst in episode 1. I highly sagest you watch it aot has great characters and they only get better as the story progresses.",2021-01-18T19:01:00+00:00,9
"(Minor spoilers)Attack on titan comes with its final season, a new studio has picked it up and with it, its complaints as well as endorsements. Story: 4 years has pasted since the time of paradis island we get to see a new cast and the surrounding wars along with how our main character Eren is involved with it. And how he has become the villain. We are shown in a realistic way how a person can change from their surroundings and how a world full of blood and war which has its moments of despair and horror as well as its moments of happiness andlastly the desires of people to prevail through any cost necessary. 

Art: The elephant in the room, the biggest problem that people have of this season, the reason so many people have gone toxic and complained. Is it really that bad? Short answer; No. 

While the usage of CGI has increased and some might find that appalling it helps build more fluid animations and fluid animations is something we see far more of in this season compared to the previous ones. The usage of rotoscoping makes the characters feel more alive compared to looking at the many still pictures of the them talking which was used before. Moreover the overall details on characters has increased both in animation and through parts of their body such as cloths and faces.

Sound: Don't even get me started with the sound, Hiroyuki Sawano, the musical/sound composer for the attack on titan franchise has done it again. The music gets you into the scenes, makes you excited for what is to come and leaves you stunned and realising what has happened only with change of a single song/tune. Amazing as always. 
The opening and ending are also great and really lets you fall in to the show even more. 

Characters: We get to see a new cast, we get to see how all the characters has changed and developed over the years. The Character development is great and thoroughly understandable on how a person can change the way they did because of their experiences. 

Enjoyment:I have enjoyed every single minute of this, be it the sometime off putting CGI or the incredible entrances and story. Every episode has made me crave for more. 

Overall: while some scenes aren't the best, this show is still amazing. It is without a doubt one of the best. 

Do I recommend this show? Yes!",2021-01-20T13:54:00+00:00,9
"At the beginning it’s a bit confusing but after a couple of episodes you start understanding everything. The end also made me want to read the manga to know what happens next, yeah, that’s how exciting it was. I am waiting for the second half and it’s gonna be awesome. I loved how you can really tell the growing of every character and the feelings each one of them feels. Personally, I realky enjoyed watching this last season very much, the story, the plot, the twists and all the other new characters where amazing. For me it’s a 10/10.  I think Aot was andis going to be a great anime and it will have a good place in our hearts forever.",2021-06-12T12:34:00+00:00,9
"I have been reading the manga since season 2 ended. I just had to know what was going to happen next. And the story just gets better and better. I was initially hyped for this because of the studio change. I love WIT studio but I have also loved the work MAPPA did for anime like Shingeki no Bahamut, Kakegurui, Banana Fish, Punch Line and most recently the phenomenal work they are doing with Jujutsu Kaisen. So I thought the final season would be in good hands. I wish I wasn't so wrong about that. I forgave WIT's use of CGI for the Colossal Titanduring the previous seasons. It was really the only time they ever used CGI. But MAPPA's heavy-handed use of it is just so disappointing. From making EVERY titan a plasticy CGI figure, to using it to shortcut quick scenes with humans using 3DMG, to episode 6's use of it for the more heavy action sequence. It's just going to get worse as time goes on. There are going to be points where 80% or more of scenes are going to be this bad CGI. Those who are reading the manga will know what I am referencing. And it will be on par with Berserk 2016.

I know MAPPA is pouring all of its resources into Jujutsu Kaisen, and I appreciate them for that. I just wish Attack on Titan didn't have to suffer for it. This show could easily end on a 10/10 for most people. But if this usage of CGI continues it's only going to drag that number down. This first part of the final season is only 16 eps long and the manga is still way far ahead with still some months to go. So hopefully they stop this and properly animate the rest of the season one Jujutsu ends.",2021-01-24T17:11:00+00:00,8
"In the first half of the season new characters. an intro, and a shit ton of other things are introduced to the show. One thing i really for sure enjoyed was the intro, all of the aot intros are fuuucking phenomenal but this one hits different. The character arcs were really unexpected but blended well with the different twists and turns of the plot, I dont care what yall say; this season was definitely not half assed and I don't understand why people talk so much shit about it...i  thought it was a little off the wall here and there but its definitely notas awful as everyone says it is. i think its going in an alright direction even though it kinda just threw the other seasons out the window, you have to look at this season with a fresh mind and eyes in order to enjoy it like you'd want to. if you can't do that, you wont get the experience you wanted or expected; period",2021-06-17T15:40:00+00:00,8
"This review contains spoilers for episode 6 and 7, read at your own discretion.Episode 6 had a lot of nail biting moment that had me hyped for the next scene and as my friend finished it and we began episode 7 I did not want to think of how this next episode could change that. I feel this season moving quickly to wrap up so many loose ends, but yet I realized there are still 9 episodes left. We have not even reached the half way mark!I sat on the edge of seat, my whole body quivering, my legs bouncing up and down, my palms planted on my thighsin a pathetic attempt to stop my moving legs, and my back arched so that my face be right in front of the monitor. These characters we bonded with for the first few episodes really made an impact on me. I know who I am rooting for in this show, but I cannot help but to feel a twang of pain and sadness as I see what I saw happen in season 1, but to a different town, to different adolescents.

There is a moment where we see a small glimpse of the photos on the steel wall of the mounted machine gun enclosure and the dread kicks in. Episode 6 tore us away from bright eyed youths, and now the slightly older role models were now being taken out by the people we cheered for and laughed at for years.

The small mention of Ymir later down the line dropped my cheerful and hyped demeanor when I realized what had happened to Ymir. I never thought about it too much until then. Dwelling on that single sentence delivery did not last long though until we were thrust back into the action of Eren and his big brain plays to crack the chrysalis of the war hammer titan. The shear fear in the jaws faces as he begs to not hurt his mates and in the start of episode 7 when we see how our troops from within the walls show no more fear for titans even ones with consciousness is incredible.

With so much to say I leave it off with the minor wondering of what is in store for Zeke, Levi, Armin, and the two young kids. At this time I hope they both some how gain powers of the titans. Whether usurping them from our own team, or given to them by their predecessors. This truly is an incredible finally and I do this season overall a 9, but it could easily become a 10. ",2021-01-26T13:38:00+00:00,9
"I can say without a doubt that this season was worth the hype/wait, everything that has happened in past episodes has actual meaning with the development of the charters. Even on past events that I was not expecting to have such a huge effect that it did. Speaking of characters, you may hear from people that they weren't huge fans to how differently the characters changed. For example Eren has become almost unrecognizable from previous seasons, even to a point where he himself feels like a new character. But if you remember what his character had to go through you can understand why he doescertain things in the show, not that you agree on what he's doing but that you can understand why. And that could be also explained to the rest of the characters as well, even the new ones who got introduced. 

And you also may hear a lot of hate towards the character Gabi because of a certain thing she has done, but I actually like the character. She's well written and shows how children can be influenced to act in a certain way. (Minor Spoiler) Like I hated Reiner and bertholdt because of what they did in season 3, but as you learn more about them in this new season you begin to like the characters despite what they did previously. Let me make it clear, THERE ARE NO GOOD OR BAD SIDES IN THIS SEASON. I'm not talking about the battle between Marley and Paradis, rather Reiner and Eren's group attacking each other. Almost every character from either side did something really bad, most of which involved killing or trying to kill kids. Which I believe is the theme of this season trying to ask the viewer what is and isn't the moral thing to do in this type of situation the characters are in. 


Story and characters out of the way lets talk about the elephant in the room which is the animation, it's overall passible to be honest. Trust me it's not that great but its also not that bad. Really the titans are the only major problem in the animation. The titans have decent CGI where its not distracting to whats happening, but every time they fight each other it looks bad. Every time the beast titan is on screen it always looks awful, especially whenever he moves his mouth and arms. It legit looks like he's a puppet being controlled. There are some instances where the titans are actually animated, but its in scenes where it always ends quickly. And there isn't really any moments where the animation is really good, like how WIT had moments where the animation elevated to what happening in the story.

Despite those problems, the season is really good.",2021-06-13T17:06:00+00:00,9
"Awful animation. Good story and perfect soundtrack. It was still fun to watch but seeing 5 fps naked man fights was awful, MAPPA dropped the ball here. It was a major step back from all of the previous seasons and it kinda ruins the legacy of attack on titan. And I'm worried about the next part because It has many more titans which MAPPA will badly animate. Aside from the bad points, the main soundtrack is amazing, I still get the chills from it. I got goosebumps for the second titan fight and the atmosphere was amazing. Even 5 fps naked mans couldn't kill thesatisfaction and enjoyment of the season. Sure it isn't great but it's not 3d berserk bad.",2021-05-14T03:53:00+00:00,8
"My favorite part of AOT so far. For those of you who don't know, part of this season takes place in Marley, another country. Now I won't go into spoilers until later in this review, but this season is incredible so far. A lot of realistic politics, clever plotting, well written characters, well drawn action. It's a perfect 10/10 to me. I'm very excited for what the final season part 2 brings.**SPOILERS ALERT****SPOILERS ALERT**My favorite part of this season was definitely Eren attacking Marley. That was just incredible. His conversation was Reiner was perfect. Reiner begging for forgiveness, for a mercy kill. He's so depressedand regretful that he wants Eren to kill him. And Eren simply says, ""Oh, I suppose I did say I'd kill you. Forget about that. And by the way, I'm the same as you."" And then he goes titan mode and kills Marleyans. Falco is a great addition to the cast, as is Gaby, although it's understandable that everyone hates Gaby. Just remember that she's brainwashed. She doesn't know that what she's doing is wrong.

Eren using the jaw titan's teeth to break the warhammer titan's shell is probably the highlight of the season for me. The voice actor for the jaw titan did a great job in his screaming. And it showed how clever and merciless Eren is. He defeated his enemies, then use one enemy's body to kill the other.

Zeke is also a super interesting character.",2021-07-03T16:00:00+00:00,10
"The wrong path for Attack on Titan.So let me beginn by saying I am still a big AoT fan and I have been ever since I binged the first two season in one sitting. When Season 3 was airing I watched the first two seasons a secound time and never missed a single Simulcast.It has been that way for the first two weeks of season 4 too but I just didn't care that much about it anymore. So I stopped watching didn't really touch it until the whole thing was released and really had to force myself to watch it till the end.Because no matterhow much I didn't like the Characters or the Story I felt like I owed every Episode a new Chance because I just loved the World they built up the first three seasons.

- Let's begin with the Good things -

The Sounddesign is incredible. Among the best in the Industry. Everything from the Opening to the Ending was amazing. I loved every OST and even the small things like the sounds their Capes make when riding was executed brilliantly.

Ah yes the Artstyle. It's something that strongly divides opinions, some people love it some people hate it but as someone who came to love this Style over years of watching AoT I can't help it but to love and appreciate it.

Pacing. Even though I did not like the Story (more of that in the negatives) I still think the speed at which it progressed was very good. I never felt like too much was thrown at me but never felt like I was getting impatient with the Characters.

- The negatives -

The Characters as well as the Story both feel like they are only trying to top the previous Seasons. AoT was always praised for having an outstanding Story and while it wasn't crazy complex it was just executed so perfectly it felt like one of a kind. In the fourth season they wanted even more people to talk about the Story but instead of creating something enjoyable with a few twists and turns the went ""fuck that"" and created at least one crazy Plottwist or reveal per Episode. 

Also I'm going to quote Gigguk's Attack on Titan Video here: ""I always loved the Worldbuilding in AoT, because it never needed huge expositionsdumps of Dialogue and Lore to lend to it's credibility that it existed cause it just felt like it did""

This is another thing they really got wrong in this Season. All the time you have conversations between people that really feel like they simply exist to make people understand the insanely complex and twisted Story and even so it's still such a confusing construct that so many people go back and rewatch some episodes just to understand what's going on. The writing in older Seasons however never really needed that.

- My conclusion - 

Honestly if it wasn't AoT I would have dropped this show. 

I will watch the (Final) Final Season in hopes they will get back to what made AoT as popular as it is. 

I rated this Season a 7 as I still have a lot of love for this Universe.",2021-04-29T14:51:00+00:00,7
"Well kids who're saying its a bad season or a trash one be realestic not because some cgi you give it a 4/10 of 10 or a 6/10 and then calling it cheap the animation was perfectly fine. This CGI models are so expensive and these CGI is considered 10/10 try watching berserk 2016 and see the trash CGI or Ajin that mostly got trash CGI or kingdom s1 or wait I will take it from AOT imagine if this season was made by wit.1. they will be forced to use CGI exactly as mappa2. it won't be the same exact art since the mangastyle completely changed. 
3. don't expect good cgi from wit it would be like the CGI Colossal titan made by wit 
You should be happy that it was made by mappa since its the best studio in terms of CGI.
The CGI was mostly smooth it looks ok other than titans it was just in normal aot quality and the bluray improved it too. so Art is 8/10 just because they were on time crunch.
-
The story what do you expect from AOT ofcourse a deep and dark theme and many plot twists and ofcourse many deaths. The showing of the other side was brilliant and many epic moments and many meanings and morals too. so as normal 10/10
-
Sound was always suiting the events specially the ashes on fire many say its overused but it wasen't actually used a lot maybe the one in zeke vs livi was not suting but the others were really good so yea 10/10
- 
Characters normally if we said AOT everyone would think of livi or erwin but the point is Erwin isn't there that time, but the introduction of many amazing new characters amazing developed characters as gabi or sasha's dad or the girl sasha saved. and how violence towards marly made them fearful so it produces violence and how someone needs to put a limit to this cycle. mikasa's thoughts for eren changed she accepted the reality too in a realestic way. armin didn't change his eyes meant a lot about his sadness and the internal conflict of paradise and how marlians entered because of that. so 10/10
-
Enjoyment for me it was the most enjoying season after s3 p2 maybe for others it wasen't like that because that CGI didn't reach the level of hand drawn animation but for me depth and plot twists affects my enjoyment the most so 10/10
-
Overall 5 times 10 is 50 so 50 + 8 is 58 so 58 divided by 6 is 9.6 so 
9.6/10",2021-08-14T15:39:00+00:00,10
"this review contain spoilersfor the story i can't deny it's blow my mind.but here is my condition, i give my attention for any battle scene and surely Levi's epic battle scene and i am always waiting for it but i have seen something different when SNK runs with MAPPA  i see minus point when the scene use CGI i feel like it 's out of place. for example levi's scene when he run from kenny and his team if feel  its very good scene than when Levi fight Beast titan at season 4 with CGI it feel like something wrong i rather whenlevi cut the beat titan all in and the visual follow up when levi cut beast titan's heands to legs with hand written visual and when ep 14 at season 4 oh it will be very very cool when not use CGI , at all the visual is very good but it still have minus point when battle scene i just feel not good.",2021-03-16T07:38:00+00:00,10
Attack On Titan is one of my favorite anime and the final season did not disappoint me for story I give a 9 the story is Great I love in the beginning of the season we get to see Marley's perspective of the world and how they live and we get to learn more about them and maybe actually feel something about them instead of just Paradis going to kill everyone we actually feel how Marley feels and how this whole situation effects them and same for Paradis with Sasha's Death and losing many comrades in the battle and how part 1 ended was amazingMarley coming to Paradis and getting revenge for what they did to Libero and the whole Eren going rouge is amazing this whole time Eren had been suffering from the wrath of the titans and now he an amazing character for art I give an 8 I mean I liked WIT better than MAPPA but MAPPA is not as bad as some fans say I actually don't mind it even though I would prefer WIT I'm not mad or sad at MAPPA for characters I give a 10 the characters are amazing in season 4 there wasn't a single character that I didn't like I mean I wish Sasha got more before she died but the characters are still amazing I could list so much characters that are amazing even the new characters like Falco and Gabi are some of my favorites as well I've seen a lot of hate on Gabi ever since she killed Sasha and honestly its attack on titan what do you expect from a dark anime about war and death. Attack On titan is not one of those anime where everyone gets saved by the power of friendship so yeah anyways Attack on Titan season 4 part 1 is a 9,2021-04-23T10:38:00+00:00,9
"Attack on Titan is that show which doesn't have any weak writing anywhere (so far) . Season 4 Part 1 was no different . Outstanding storyline , direction and soundtrack (which was surprised , since Sawano wasn't doing it this time, but Kohta Yamamoto NAILED it ) . The CGI wasn't  bad (if u think this was bad , u will get blinded if u see Berserk 2016), but that definitely was a stepdown from WIT studio's hand drawn titan (someone may argue that MAPPA had been given waaay lesser time, but it was the output that people see , which clearly was adowngrade, but I definitely respect the hard work by MAPPA) . Something I was disappointed by was the ODM gear action , cuz of the HIGH bar WIT had set , but MAPPA couldn't reach (but then again , way lesser time) . also , I personally preferred WIT's style (MAPPA's is manga accurate , but then ,doing that wasn't NECESSARY) .But anyways , i REALLY enjoyed season 4 part one , and have even higher hopes for season 4 part 2 , which I am sure MAPPA will be able to deliver .",2021-08-12T19:59:00+00:00,9
"Literally the best anime I've watched (still ongoing), and the best manga I've read. The story? Perfect. The characters? Amazing. The art? Astounding. The soundtrack? The best (in my opinion). Watched twice because the amount of foreshadowing that it contains is just too good to be true. Would recommend this to literally anyone if they asked ""what's a good anime to watch?"" People say they got bored after the first episode or they'd say ""it's not my type"" but in reality, you gotta give it a chance, do that and it's easily one of the best anime/manga in existence. The anime got better every seasonand there's no question about it. Back before I watched Shingeki no Kyojin, I thought it was weird like ""who watches titans eat people for fun"", but once I watched it, I realized how much of a masterpiece of an anime this is. Out of curiosity I read the manga too and was amazed with how perfect it is. The soundtrack also fits every scene perfectly. Watching some scenes with certain soundtracks or just listening to the soundtracks at random times in the day gives me goosebumps as to how good and amazing it is. Hiroyuki Sawano (composer) did a fantastic job doing the soundtrack for this anime as it fits perfectly.",2021-02-28T13:30:00+00:00,10
"If you thought titans were scary, boy do I have news for you! Titans are about to get a lot scarier in this season, and humans will as well. You are in for one heck of a ride from episode 1 to the very last scene in the finale, and it’s so worth it. (spoiler free) Story - 10The story expands a lot in season four. It’s a lot to handle, as the story is making a swift shift from humans v.s titans to humans v.s humans AND introducing a whole new community. A lot of new information is given about titans and exactly why Reinerdid what he did. Excellent writing, even during the slower part at the beginning. Once you get to the second half of the season you get to see Eren just go berserk and it’s amazing to watch! Great titan action as well!

 Art - 10
The art is still great! 
 
Sound - 10
WOW, that opening! At first I was a tiny bit turned off since it sounded pretty crazy, but now I’m obsessed. It’s so catchy. Really puts you in the mindset for how insane this season is. I really recommend looking up the full version on youtube, you won’t regret it! 
 
Characters - 9
You probably know why this can’t be a 10.... Gabi. I can’t stand her. I know she is only 12 and brainwashed, but she seriously does no critical thinking. Her friend is able to actually respect people even though he grew up with the same brainwashing as Gabi. When they meet the “island devils” who actually end up being extremely generous and kind, Gabi doesn’t even think twice about her hatred for them. I mean come on, how hypocritical can you be? She is once told that the “island devils” can actually be nice people, and she responds by saying “well have you seen them be nice for yourself, or have you just heard that? If you haven’t seen it then stop!” Okay, fair enough. But Gabi, a few episodes later you experience their kindness first hand. And let’s not forget that you have never seen the history of these people that you claim makes them devils, because it happened many many years ago. So stop being a hypocrite, and maybe just consider that you don’t need to hate on these people just because someone told you to! 
 
Enjoyment - 9
I really enjoyed this season. So much suspense, and the ending really leaves you wanting more. The action scenes were AMAZING but I also really loved the humans v.s humans element. Also I love the addition of new titans like the war hammer titan, and more screen time for the cart titan and others. These titans are extra scary but so fun to watch. It was a little confusing because of how many new elements were added at once, that is my critique. 
 
Overall - 9
I loved this season, it was perfectly chaotic! Really shows you how far gone some of the characters are, and what war does to people. 

 TLDR: A great season for Attack on Titan. Lots of action and plot twists. Super enjoyable!",2021-05-04T19:32:00+00:00,9
"OK so spoilers for every season exept the final seson (there is soe minor spoils for season 4 but u only neeed to watch the 4 ep of s 4)ok so i dont think u need introduction to the masterpiece that is aot. yea well ima divide this into 6 parts read tll the end plsstory - 20/10ok so first season and first half of aot is mediocre and meh . but the moment season 2 episode 6 hits i understood something.. that what this series is morphing into can be a good story . i emphasise on the words a good story i thoughtit would be a 8/10 anime ( a 8 in my book is really good) then season 3 prt 1 came and was like oh oh oh u thought season 2 was good hold my beer . season 3 part 1 straight up explored the politics and explained a lotta things about the political infrastructure  and made characters like kenny levi and erwin infinetly well written . then i wasnlike uh aot cmt get better than this this is a 10/10 then season 3 part 2 came like a frickin meteorite and hit me on the face . u like the fast pacing and  mazing animtion of season 1 here u go u like the more methodical and better build up of season 2 here u go u like the lore and politics of season 3 part 1 here u go season 3 part 1 just literally took every good thing bout ot te multiplied it 10 fold and gave it to us in 10 ACTION packed episodes. we  now know the world and its lore we know what the titans are u see everything in aot just makes sense ok so enough bout the story lemme move to the next area.

art - 9/10
u see the 3d anuever sceness r good but the titan some times melt in between scenes and the collosal titn looked like it straight up xzame from a ugly bastard henti. but other thn this the art is top not . AND NO THE CG IN MAPPA IS AMAZING EXEPT FOR THAT 2 SCENES IN EP 6 OF FINAL SESON.

sound- 15/10
ok so aot has 2 main ost 1 is vogel in kaig andd ashes on fire so vogel in kafig has this creepy and mysterious feel which is perfevt for 1st 3 seaon then we have ashes on fire which has this bombastic grnd music and creepiness it glorifies war thats what shes on fire does i think that ost of aot iis the best in not only anime but every mediums (lso ever op exept red swan is phuckin awesome)

character 9.5/10

pk so GO WTCH AOT IF U HAVENT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH",2021-02-25T21:00:00+00:00,10
"(SOME SPOILERS FOR AOT S4) This review is all my opinion.For me, Seasons 2 and 3 of Attack On Titan were some of the best anime experiences I've had in recent time, and after watching this follow up to the other parts of this show, I have to say I feel very disappointed.Story: 6, For this anime the story has always been mixed for me, because it's sometimes amazing how they can fit so many backstories and character moments that make this cast feel real. But on the other hand there are large segments (specifically the first 6 and last 2 episodes of season 3)where it feels way too quickly paced and sloppy, making it hard to understand to the point where even now that I have finished the whole anime I still can't understand the stuff that happened all that time ago. Season 4 has done the same thing season 3 has done except you never catch on because there's even more confusing story elements than back then. The worldbuilding is an absolute train wreck, not because it's necessarily bad (though i personally don't like it) but because they explain so much so quickly that i still only understand half the stuff that's happening. This has always been a problem since season 3, and it seems my friends/family that have watched also agree with me. Anyways, if season 3 did that and i still loved that season then why is season 4 worse? Well, it's because the annoying and bland new cast they introduced. They introduced new characters in the new season which i usually don't mind, but they don't feel like characters, they feel like plot devices and emotional robots to get the story across to us. Yelena has the generic ""i want to see the world burn"" personality that every personality-less anime character needs, and not just her. Gabi could of been a great character, they even gave her 4 episodes of setup along with the other warriors (which i personally found better than the rest of the season) but they somehow made her feel like a plot device just running into coincidence after coincidence to show the conflict between Eldians and the world. It all feels forced in my opinion, and her killing one of the main characters then just happening to run into her family was way too coincidental to be true. Enough about her, Floch was introduced at the end of last season, and was clearly set up to be a new and important character. I didn't personally like him that much, it felt forced. But i was accepting to see him join the survey corps or whatever he was going to take part in. Turns out that he is just a generic evil minion of Eren, Who now owns some sort of cult. ON TO EREN!!! But first I wanna talk about character designs. I don't like the character designs as much as before but they don't effect my score or anything, I just personally think everybody looks worse than before, with exception of Armin and Eren looking just as cool as before. Two more things before Eren, there were multiple occasions where certain things could of and should of happened but they didn't. Reiner and the Jaw titan were both sitting on the floor, passed out. The survey corps could of easily gotten them both under Eren's order to make sure they aren't in any danger, and also so the enemy loses 2 of their most valuable assets. Also, when Zackery's office was blown up, Mikasa and Armin didn't get questioned at all, until much after, in which there were absolutely no consequences besides being accused of being a yeagerist for 1 second in a throwaway line. Next thing, the animation/art style change. Everyone has complained about this so I'm just going to say that i don't like it at all, I get that this season is dark, but every season has been dark. The other seasons had this beautiful and unique art style that matched the manga really well, The colors popped and it was always a treat to watch scenes, hell even the non-fight scenes were just so beautiful looking most of the time. But now it has this dark, gross, boring looking art style. Anyways, that's just my opinion, but it just lacks personality compared to the other seasons. Speaking of Animation/Art style/Whatever, The CG is god awful, it is so distracting, it just looks plain off, and its ugly. The CG with the colossal titan was always off putting and ugly, but it felt somewhat special since it was so big. But now every titan that isn't a normal one is in CG, it contrasts with the rest of the art style and honestly ruined all of the scenes involving titans in this season for me. Next is something that is 100% personal, but i do not care for or about the outside world. The series was much more interesting within the walls, and i feel that figuring out the ""truth"" ruined it all. I feel it could of been much better if the series ended with the truth/the outside, but i was still on board. I was on board the whole time until there was about 6 or so episodes left, for the rest of that i was just waiting to finish it, sitting there bored. All in all this season was very disappointing and flat out bad in my opinion. Though there were some cool parts, most of them were ruined by the surrounding boredom and confusing world building that was brain-rotting to take in so quickly. For sure this is a 5/10 for me, I really wanted to like this season, and i can see many reasons why. The potential for the Discrimination within the world vs the Eldians, The building of the Yeagerists, The Warriors who sadly became a bunch of boring characters used as plot devices and were flat out not entertaining in the slightest. Everything was just wasted potential and completely 2-Dimensional, at least that's how I saw it.",2021-08-05T20:32:00+00:00,5
"The anime here got a drastic change from being a semi-psychological anime with mystery and cliffhangers to a new whole world and perspective of their life, Gabi is a very well written character and can understand the hate she gets. Eren in this season seems like a complete different person and some people may think his real character and personality dies, the Eren of 14 to 16 years was a hopeful guy with a dream, but this Eren got his mind clear in an objective and saw the real world, he uses the titan powers with so much intelligence and shows his experience using thepowers in battles and danger situations. I'm sorry to get the manga in the review, but if you read the manga, you'll definetly understand why Eren did such things, also, he didn't laugh when Sasha died, as we saw back in season 2, his form of showing frustration, anger, stress and that type of emotions is laughing with tears. Such a incredible character, the final ruined all, but leaving that apart, Eren is a great character.
The use of CGI is completely understandable because Mappa was doing 2 of the biggest projects/animes of the world, making Shingeki no Kyojin and Jujutsu Kaisen at the same time is a thing out of this world, the animation and art style from those two animes are in a level very rare to see, only a few cases like Violet Evergarden, Kimetsu no Yaiba, Fate and Bishounen Tanteidan can make that achievement. The soundtrack was pretty good for not using a opening from Linked Horizon(which was the group that made all the openings before Boku no Sensou). I enjoyed this season, but nos as much as the 3rd, the studio change hits very hard and left me with hype for the part 2 of this season, for when this finishes, I'll change this review with a better qualification, but for the moment, I'm rating the content whe have animated. 
SPOILER
If they change that regular final, I may give this anime a 10, wich is deserved for such a world and story like this.",2021-08-11T18:42:00+00:00,9
"First review on an anime wooooooo. This whole story was a journey and I have enjoyed it from the very start of season 1. The plot is interesting, characters are well written, art, music, everything is great. I love how well the plot has built up over these past seasons up till now. I love the focus on details and backstories of a lot of the characters. It's one of those animes that really made me feel all kinds of emotions and that's not something often for me when it comes to anime and probably any show or movie in general. While re-watching some earlierepisodes from previous seasons I was kinda shocked at how much foreshadowing and little details that were put in there that I've missed.  I was really surprised at how much has changed especially in this season, good and bad. *cough, Eren, cough*. I am really looking forward on the part 2 of this and am feeling a bit sad that this beautiful master piece is coming to an end really soon but also can't wait to see how it ends. 

10/10 will probably watch 12032928293272846 times again. &lt;3",2021-08-27T23:55:00+00:00,10
